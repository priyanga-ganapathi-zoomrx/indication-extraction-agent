Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard that exerts its anti-neoplastic effects through alkylation. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, and other key factors of cyclophosphamide as a valuable agent in the treatment and management of neoplastic diseases by an interprofessional team. There is also a discussion of cyclophosphamide use in the management of severe multiple sclerosis.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n* Identify the mechanism of action and administration of cyclophosphamide.\n* Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of cyclophosphamide.\n* Review the appropriate monitoring and toxicity of cyclophosphamide.\n* Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cyclophosphamide and improve outcomes.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=20199&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=20199)\n\n## Indications\n\nAccording to the FDA, cyclophosphamide is mainly indicated for use in the treatment of malignant lymphomas stages III and IV, as designated by the Ann Arbor staging system. These may include Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocytic lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.[[1]](#article-20199.r1)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)\n\nOther FDA approved indications of cyclophosphamide include use in the treatment of breast cancer, disseminated neuroblastomas, retinoblastoma, minimal change nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients, and ovarian adenocarcinomas. As an effective immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide multiple studies have found cyclophosphamide useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Cyclophosphamide has also been prescribed pretransplant as an immunosuppressant to prevent transplant rejection and graft-vs-host complications.[[3]](#article-20199.r3)[[4]](#article-20199.r4)\n\n## Mechanism of Action\n\nCyclophosphamide is a type of nitrogen mustard drug which exerts its effects through the alkylation of DNA. The drug is not cell-cycle phase-specific and metabolizes to an active form capable of inhibiting protein synthesis through DNA and RNA crosslinking. [[1]](#article-20199.r1)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)\n\nThe majority of the antineoplastic effects of cyclophosphamide are due to the phosphoramide mustard formed from the metabolism of the drug by liver enzymes like cytochrome P-450. Hepatic enzymes first convert cyclophosphamide to hydroxycyclophosphamide and then subsequently metabolized to aldophosphamide. Aldophosphamide is cleaved to the active alkylating agent phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. The phosphoramide metabolite forms cross-linkages within and between adjacent DNA strands at the guanine N-7 position. These modifications are permanent and eventually lead to programmed cell death.[[4]](#article-20199.r4) Acrolein has no antitumor activity but is the principal-agent responsible for the manifestation of hemorrhagic cystitis.\n\nIn addition to antimitotic and antineoplastic effects, cyclophosphamide has immunosuppressive effects and selectivity for T cells. High-dose cyclophosphamide is used in eradication therapy of malignant hematopoietic cells, while lower dosages have shown merit for use in selective immunomodulation of regulatory T cells. The drug decreases the secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-12 while increasing the secretion of Th2 cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 in the CSF and peripheral blood.[[5]](#article-20199.r5)[[6]](#article-20199.r6) Due to these effects, cyclophosphamide is considered as a valuable addition to tumor vaccination protocols, post-transplant alloreactivity management, and the treatment of immune-mediated conditions and some forms of vasculitis.[[7]](#article-20199.r7)[[1]](#article-20199.r1)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)While the precise mechanism with which cyclophosphamide exerts its immunomodulatory effects are not completely clear, several studies have suggested a few probable modes of action. These include the elimination of regulatory T cells in naïve or malignant host cells, the induction of T cell growth factors like type I interferons, and preconditioning host cells for donor T cells, thus reducing alloreactivity.[[5]](#article-20199.r5)[[7]](#article-20199.r7)[[6]](#article-20199.r6)\n\n## Administration\n\nIn the treatment of a variety of malignancies, clinicians use cyclophosphamide in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. It is often included in standard treatment regimens for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a component of CHOP along with hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone. If the malignancy has B-cell involvement, rituximab, and an anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody, it is added to the CHOP regimen (called R-CHOP).[[5]](#article-20199.r5)[[8]](#article-20199.r8)[[9]](#article-20199.r9)Cyclophosphamide has also been used in combination with corticosteroids in the treatment of multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and various types of sarcoma. As cyclophosphamide exerts immunosuppressive properties in addition to its anti-neoplastic effects, it is indicated in the management of other immune conditions such as severe multiple sclerosis and nephrotic syndrome.[[10]](#article-20199.r10)[[11]](#article-20199.r11)\n\nCyclophosphamide is often orally administered, and the length of treatment and dosage depends upon individual factors such as metabolism, drug interactions, body mass, and age of the patient. There are standard guidelines available for the appropriate dosage and indications depending upon the goal of treatment. The general recommendation for patients without hematological deficiencies is an induction dose of IV cyclophosphamide of 40 to 50 mg/kg divided into dosages over 2 to 5 days. The maintenance dosage is dependent upon individual tolerance but is generally 1 to 5 mg/kg taken orally every day. A daily oral dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg is recommended for pediatric patients. It should not be taken for more than 90 days to avoid hemorrhagic cystitis and sterility risk in males. The recommendation for the oral formulation is that it be taken at the same time every day, usually in the morning, with liquid. If GI irritation is noted, the tablet can be taken with food.[[10]](#article-20199.r10)[[4]](#article-20199.r4)While taking cyclophosphamide, an adequate intake of fluids is necessary to precipitate diuresis to reduce the risk of urinary tract side effects. To avoid the side effect of hemorrhagic cystitis, maintain a minimum urinary output of 100 mL/hr during therapy.[[9]](#article-20199.r9)\n\nMesna is a prophylactic cytoprotective drug administered orally or by IV to reduce the effects of hemorrhagic cystitis in patients treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide. The recommended dosage of Mesna is generally as a fractionated dosing schedule of three IV bolus injections of 240 mg per meter cubed every 4 hours.[[3]](#article-20199.r3)[[4]](#article-20199.r4)\n\n## Adverse Effects\n\nThe main areas of concern regarding the adverse side effects of cyclophosphamide are associated with bladder and gonadal toxicity. Common adverse side effects reported in several studies and clinical trials involving the use of cyclophosphamide include hemorrhagic cystitis, amenorrhea, myelosuppression, alopecia, and spells of nausea and vomiting. [[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[13]](#article-20199.r13)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)Chronic or recurrent hemorrhagic cystitis is a side effect of particular clinical significance and may arise from the use of cyclophosphamide without adequate hydration or concurrent administration of mesna. The limiting factor in cyclophosphamide dosage in the treatment of neoplasms and immune-inflammatory conditions is urinary tract toxicity.  The severity of hemorrhagic cystitis may vary from light pinkish to exsanguinating hemorrhage. Other urinary tract symptoms include increased urinary frequency and urgency due to urinary clot retention, nocturia, and dysuria.[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[7]](#article-20199.r7)[[3]](#article-20199.r3)As previously outlined, acrolein is the principal-agent involved in the precipitation of hemorrhagic cystitis. The metabolite causes heightened vascular fragility and dilatation, irritation of the bladder mucosa, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and endogenous nitric oxide leading to hemorrhage. Prolonged exposure to acrolein may increase the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis. Due to the dose and time-dependent nature of the severity of this symptom, th recommendation is that the patient intake adequate fluids to force diuresis and reduce exposure of urothelium to acrolein. Continuous bladder irrigation and mesna use are also helpful in the management of drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.[[5]](#article-20199.r5)[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[6]](#article-20199.r6)\n\nCyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression leading to the development of sepsis and septic shock. Antibiotic therapy and additional surveillance may be warranted at the discretion of the treatment team.There are also reports of cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, veno-occlusive liver disease, and secondary malignancies in some cases of cyclophosphamide use. Myocarditis, pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure are possible risks. Higher dosages of cyclophosphamide are associated with a greater incidence of these side effects and increased mortality.[[13]](#article-20199.r13)[[10]](#article-20199.r10)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)\n\nThe alkylating effects of cyclophosphamide may also affect the processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, leading to sterility in both sexes. The risk of sterility of time and dose-dependent and is irreversible in some patients. Sterility may manifest as amenorrhea in women and testicular atrophy in men. Patients should receive adequate education on the risks of infertility before initiation of cyclophosphamide therapy.[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[7]](#article-20199.r7)\n\n## Contraindications\n\nAs with any drug, the use of cyclophosphamide is not recommended in patients with allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to the drug or any of its metabolites. Deaths from anaphylactic reactions, as well as adverse interactions with other chemotherapy drugs like busulfan or chlorambucil, have been reported.Patients with urinary flow obstructive conditions should not take cyclophosphamide due to an increased risk of developing hemorrhagic clot retention.[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[10]](#article-20199.r10)[[2]](#article-20199.r2)[[14]](#article-20199.r14)\n\nPregnant or nursing women should not take cyclophosphamide as the use of the drug has been associated with embryo-fetal toxicity. Cyclophosphamide is present in breast milk, and exposure may cause congenital disabilities, delayed development, and fetal death. It is a strong recommendation that female patients receiving treatment with cyclophosphamide avoid pregnancy during treatment and use contraceptive measures during treatment and up to a full year following completion of treatment.[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[7]](#article-20199.r7)[[13]](#article-20199.r13)\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe monitoring of complete blood counts in patients is an essential part of the management of cyclophosphamide toxicity. As cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression, it should not be used in patients with lab values of neutrophils of 1500/mm^3 or less and platelets less than 50000/mm^3. CBC values should be monitored in addition to the administration of G-CSF to reduce the effects of neutropenia and infection risk.[[4]](#article-20199.r4)[[15]](#article-20199.r15)[[16]](#article-20199.r16)Before the induction of cyclophosphamide treatment, any urinary obstructions should be corrected or excluded. Urinalysis is also a recommendation to evaluate for the presence of hematuria, proteinuria, or bacterial infections. Patients also require monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and history of pre-existing cardiac disease. These tests may include tests for cholesterol, lipids, and triglycerides. The gold-standard test is generally considered to be an angiogram taken during cardiac catheterization or non-invasively via computed tomography.[[5]](#article-20199.r5)[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[13]](#article-20199.r13)[[17]](#article-20199.r17)[[14]](#article-20199.r14)\n\nPatients experiencing severe symptoms of cyclophosphamide toxicity may be taken off the medication or have their dose reduced by their physician.[[12]](#article-20199.r12)[[18]](#article-20199.r18)[[3]](#article-20199.r3)[[16]](#article-20199.r16)\n\n## Toxicity\n\nClinicians need to consider possible side effects, interactions, and associated toxicities should before administering cyclophosphamide. As an immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide toxicity correlates with the development of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. These conditions may lead to the occurrence of recurrent infections and may interfere with wound healing. Other symptoms of cyclophosphamide toxicity include GI disturbances, alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis, renal tubular necrosis, infertility, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiotoxicity. The manifestation of cyclophosphamide toxicity becomes aggravated by concurrent use of phenobarbital, other myelosuppressives, radiation, and succinylcholine.[[19]](#article-20199.r19)[[20]](#article-20199.r20)\n\nTo minimize the negative effects of cyclophosphamide toxicity, recommendations include monitoring the patient’s hematologic profile and modification of treatment as needed. Patients should maintain adequate hydration, and mesna can be prescribed as prophylaxis against the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. If overdose is suspected, the patient or caregiver must seek emergency medical attention immediately.[[20]](#article-20199.r20)\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nIn the development of professional health care delivery, the ability of interprofessional health care providers to work as a cohesive unit has been proven to increase the quality of patient care and increase positive prognostic outcomes. This paradigm is achieved through integrated patient-centered care, sharing of values, communication, and a clear definition of interprofessional responsibilities.[[21]](#article-20199.r21)[[22]](#article-20199.r22)\n\nIn the modern health care environment, patients rely on effective teamwork within a team of health professionals. This methodology should include primary care providers, oncologists, specialty care nurses, and oncologic pharmacists. Effective communication minimizes errors and potential adverse events. Various studies on effective leadership and team development have supported Tuckman’s stages of group development. In this model, a team undergoes four stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. Passing through all of these stages is both necessary and inevitable for an effective team to form. Following this process, the members of the team are better able to assess their roles and the roles of others on the team. Each member possesses specialized skills and knowledge complementary to the others, allowing for heightened patient care.[[23]](#article-20199.r23)\n\nThis coordination is key in the appropriate use of cyclophosphamide. Adhering to the Team-Based Competencies set forth by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative, including honesty, discipline, and mutual goals, the healthcare team, is better able to assess the appropriate management of cyclophosphamide use. On an organizational level, enhanced teamwork can lead to reduced time and costs associated with hospitalizations, reduced unexpected admissions, and increased ease of access to services. From a patient’s perspective, effective teamwork means increased satisfaction with care, improved prognosis, and a reduction in medical error.[[22]](#article-20199.r22) [Level 1]\n\nInterprofessional team dynamics in using cyclophosphamide include the prescriber deciding it is the appropriate agent for the patient, but that is only the beginning. A board-certified oncology pharmacist should be consulted regarding potential drug interactions, appropriate dosing, and have involvement in the ongoing monitoring of the patient. Once on the drug, oncology specialty nurses should have involvement in monitoring the patient for treatment progress as well as adverse drug reactions and can reach out to the oncology pharmacist and/or the oncologist as appropriate. These interprofessional examples will result in better outcomes with cyclophosphamide.

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking [guanine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/guanine) bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add [methyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/methyl) or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.\n\nDrugBank\n\n### 8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=MeSH-Pharmacological-Classification&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nImmunosuppressive Agents\n\nAgents that suppress immune function by one of several mechanisms of action. Classical cytotoxic immunosuppressants act by inhibiting DNA synthesis. Others may act through activation of T-CELLS or by inhibiting the activation of HELPER CELLS.

The CYP2B6 isoform is the enzyme with the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide undergoes activation to eventually form active metabolites, [phosphoramide mustard](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphoramide%20mustard) and [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein). Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism which results in an overall increase in clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites, and shortened t1/2 values following repeated administration.\n\nDrugBank\n\n... /Cyclophosphamide/ is activated by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. Cyclophosphamide is first converted to [4-hydroxycyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-hydroxycyclophosphamide), which is in a steady state with the acyclic tautomer [aldophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/aldophosphamide). In vitro studies with human liver microsones & cloned P450 isoenzymes have shown that cyclophosphamide is activated by the CYP2B group of P450 isoenzymes... . [4-hydroxycyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) may be oxidized further by aldehyde oxidase either in liver or in tumor tissue & perhaps by other enzymes, yielding the metabolites [carboxyphosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/carboxyphosphamide)& 4-ketocyclophsphamide, neither of which possesses significant biological activity. It appears that hepatic damage is minimized by theses secondary reactions, whereas significantl amoutns of the active metabolies, such as [4-hydroxycyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)& its tautomer, aldophosphamed, are transported to the target sites by the circulatory system. In tumor cells, the [aldophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/aldophosphamide) cleaves spontaneously, generating stoichiometric amounts of [phosphoramide mustard](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphoramide%20mustard)&[acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein). The former is believed to be responsible for antitumor effects. The latter cmpd may be responsible for the hemorrhagic cystitis seen during therapy with cyclophosphamide.

It is also administered intravenously. This drug is metabolized in the liver to the cytotoxic metabolite, [4-hydroxycyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-hydroxycyclophosphamide), which is in equilibrium with the acyclic tautomer, [aldophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/aldophosphamide). Although the major fraction of these metabolites is oxidized further to inactive products, some [aldophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/aldophosphamide) is converted to phophoramidemustard, which alkylates DNA, and to [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein).\n\nAmerican Medical Association, Council on Drugs.

The CYP2B6 isoform is the enzyme with the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide undergoes activation to eventually form active metabolites, [phosphoramide mustard](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphoramide%20mustard) and [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein). Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism which results in an overall increase in clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites, and shortened t1/2 values following repeated administration. Route of Elimination: Cyclophosphamide is eliminated primarily in the form of metabolites. 10-20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration.

These reactions result in the formation of covalent linkages by alkylation of various nucleophilic moieties such as [phosphate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphate), amino, sulfhydryl, [hydroxyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyl), carboxyl, &[imidazole](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/imidazole) groups. The chemotherapeutic & cytotoxic effects are directly related to the alkylation of DNA. The 7 [nitrogen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Nitrogen) atom of [guanine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/guanine) is particularly susceptible to the formation of a covalent bond with bifunctional alkylating agents & may well represent the key target that determines their biological effects. It must be appreciated, however, that other atoms in the [purine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/purine)& pyrimidine bases of DNA- particularly, the 1 & 3 nitrogens of [adenine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/adenine), the 3 [nitrogen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Nitrogen) of [cytosine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cytosine), & the 6 [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) of [guanine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/guanine)- also may be alkylated, as will be the [phosphate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphate) atoms of the DNA chains & amino & sulfhydryl groups of proteins. /Alkylating agents/\n\nHardman, J.G., L.E. Limbird, P.B. Molinoff, R.W. Ruddon, A.G. Goodman (eds.). Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1996., p. 1389\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nCyclophosphamide can be used to cause immunologically mediated regression of the immunogenic, cyclophosphamide-resistant L5178Y lymphoma in syngeneic and semisyngeneic mice (B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 x DBA/2) females). In order to cause tumor regression it was necessary to give cyclophosphamide (125-200 mg/kg of body wt, iv shortly before or shortly after tumor implantation. Regardless of whether cyclophosphamide was given before or after tumor implantation, tumor regression was associated with the presence in the spleen of an incr number of Lyt-2+ T-cells capable of passively transferring immunity to tumor bearing recipients. This augmented level of immunity was sustained throughout the period of tumor regression. In contrast, a lower level of concomitant immunity generated by control tumor bearers decayed after day 12 of tumor growth. Because the therapeutic effect of cyclophosphamide could be inhibited by passive transfer of L3T4+ T-cells from normal donor mice it is apparent that the therapeutic effect of cyclophosphamide is based on its ability to preferentially destroy L3T4+ suppressor T-cells. These putative precursor suppressor T-cells were regenerated 4 days after being destroyed by cyclophosphamide.\n\n[PMID:2522344](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2522344)\n\nAwwad M, North RJ; Cancer Res 49 (7): 1649-54 (1989)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nThese studies enable the pattern of emesis and nausea for 3 days following high-dose cyclophosphamide to be described and give some insight into the mechanisms of emesis which may be operating. Nausea and vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy has long latency of onset (8-13 hr) and continues for at least 3 days. These findings are of particular importance as many of these patients receive chemotherapy as outpatients and emphasize the need for appropriate anti-emetic prophylaxis for patients at home. [Ondansetron](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ondansetron) was extremely effective over this time in the control of emesis and nausea. These results suggest that high-dose cyclophosphamide-induced emesis over days 1-3 is largely mediated via [5-hydroxytryptamine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-hydroxytryptamine) ([5-HT](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-HT)) and 5-HT3 receptors.\n\nBeck TM; Anticancer Dugs 6 (2): 237-42 (1995)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nThe most likely mechanism by which cyclophosphamide augments immune responses relates to preferential elimination of suppressor and relative sparing of effector and helper cells. Thus, precursors and mature murine suppressor cells are very sensitive to cyclophosphamide whereas the mature effector cells are relatively insensitive ... . Cyclophosphamide induced immunological regression of murine leukemia is reversed by the infusion of normal spleen cells as a source of precursors of suppressor cells ... . Memory and helper T cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cyclophosphamide ... . NK activity against YAC lymphoma targets by non T and non B cells is depressed by cyclophosphamide ... .\n\nFoye, W.O. (ed.). Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents. ACS Professional Reference Book.

Exposure to this odorless, white, crystalline powder may occur from its manufacture, formulation, or distribution for use as an antineoplastic drug. Effects from exposure may include fever, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, hemorrhagic colitis, hepatitis, leukopenia, and pneumonitis or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Cyclophosphamide has been indicated as a human carcinogen (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Exposure should be controlled by mechanical ventilation with high-efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) or [charcoal](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/charcoal) filters to minimize the amount of the substance in exhausted air. In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear protective clothing and a carefully fitted respirator. Potentially exposed skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water). Contaminated clothing should be removed and discarded or left at the work site for cleaning before reuse. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in cyclophosphamide work areas. Cyclophosphamide should be stored and transported in securely sealed glass bottles or ampoules, which are in turn placed inside strong screw-cap or snap-top containers. Also, the material should be stored cool (below 30 °C), dry, and shielded from light. This substance is a good candidate for disposal by rotary kiln, or fluidized bed forms of incineration.\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\n#### 11.1.6 Skin, Eye, and Respiratory Irritations[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Skin-Eye-and-Respiratory-Irritations&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nA powerful skin irritant. \n\nLewis, R.J.

Flush victim's eyes with [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) or [normal saline](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/normal%20saline) solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.\n\nSKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water). IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.\n\nINHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.\n\nINGESTION: If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Generally, the induction of vomiting is NOT recommended outside of a physician's care due to the risk of aspirating the chemical into the victim's lungs. However, if the victim is conscious and not convulsing and if medical help is not readily available, consider the risk of inducing vomiting because of the high toxicity of the chemical ingested. Ipecac syrup or salt [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) may be used in such an emergency. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.\n\nOTHER: Since this chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen you should contact a physician for advice regarding the possible long term health effects and potential recommendation for medical monitoring. Recommendations from the physician will depend upon the specific compound, its chemical, physical and toxicity properties, the exposure level, length of exposure, and the route of exposure.

All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet.

As an immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide toxicity correlates with the development of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. These conditions may lead to the occurrence of recurrent infections and may interfere with wound healing. Other symptoms of cyclophosphamide toxicity include GI disturbances, alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis, renal tubular necrosis, infertility, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiotoxicity. The manifestation of cyclophosphamide toxicity becomes aggravated by concurrent use of [phenobarbital](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phenobarbital), other myelosuppressives, radiation, and [succinylcholine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/succinylcholine).\n\nTo minimize the negative effects of cyclophosphamide toxicity, recommendations include monitoring the patient’s hematologic profile and modification of treatment as needed. Patients should maintain adequate hydration, and [mesna](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mesna) can be prescribed as prophylaxis against the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. If overdose is suspected, the patient or caregiver must seek emergency medical attention immediately.\n\nStatPearls\n\nAlkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. \n\nToxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB)\n\n#### 12.1.2 RAIS Toxicity Values[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=RAIS-Toxicity-Values&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nInhalation Unit Risk (IUR) (ug/m^3)^-1\n\n0.00017 \n\nInhalation Unit Risk Reference\n\nCALEPA \n\nOral Slope Factor (CSFo)(mg/kg-day)^-1\n\n0.61 \n\nOral Slope Factor Reference\n\nCALEPA \n\nRisk Assessment Information System (RAIS)\n\n#### 12.1.3 Hepatotoxicity[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Hepatotoxicity&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nMild and transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are found in up to 43% of patients with cancer who are treated with cyclophosphamide. The abnormalities are generally asymptomatic and transient and do not require dose modification. Enzyme elevations are more common with higher doses and with intravenous therapy. In some instances, marked elevations arise warranting dose modification or discontinuation of cyclophosphamide (Case 3).\n\nClinically apparent liver injury from standard doses of cyclophosphamide is uncommon, but several case reports of acute liver injury with jaundice have been published (Cases 1 and 2). The onset is within 2 to 8 weeks of starting cyclophosphamide and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations is hepatocellular. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are uncommon. The injury in most cases is self-limited and resolves within 1 to 3 months of stopping; however, fatal instances have been reported. Recurrence on reexposure has been described.\n\nHigh doses of cyclophosphamide given as chemotherapy of cancer or as myeloablative therapy in combination of total body irradiation or [busulfan](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/busulfan) in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation can induce sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease), which can be severe leading to acute liver failure and death. The onset of injury is usually within 10 to 20 days of the myeloablation and is characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain, weight gain, ascites, marked increase in serum aminotransferase levels (and lactic dehydrogenase), and subsequent jaundice and hepatic dysfunction. The severity of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome varies from a transient, self limited injury to acute liver failure. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical features of tenderness and enlargement of the liver, weight gain, ascites and jaundice. Liver biopsy is diagnostic but often contraindicated, because of severe thrombocytopenia after hematopoietic cell transplantation.\n\nLikelihood score: B (highly likely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).\n\nLiverTox\n\n#### 12.1.4 Drug Induced Liver Injury[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Drug-Induced-Liver-Injury&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\n1 of 3 items\n\nDataset\n\nDrug Induced Liver Injury Rank (DILIrank 2.0) \n\nCompound\n\nCyclophosphamide \n\nvDILI-Concern\n\nv Less-DILI-concern\n\nSeverity Class\n\n5 \n\nLabel Section\n\nAdverse reactions \n\nReferences\n\n[DOI:10.1016/j.drudis.2016.02.015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2016.02.015)\n\nFDA Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB)\n\n2 of 3 items\n\nDataset\n\nBenchmark Dataset for the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB) \n\nCompound\n\ncyclophosphamide \n\nBrand name\n\nCytoxan® \n\nTherapeutic category\n\nAntineoplastic agents \n\nDILI severity Score\n\n5 \n\nDILI concern\n\nless-DILI-concern drugs \n\nStatus/label\n\nAdverse Reactions \n\nReference\n\n[DOI:10.1016/j.drudis.2011.05.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2011.05.007)\n\nFDA Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB)\n\n3 of 3 items\n\nDataset\n\nDrug-Induced Liver Injury Severity and Toxicity (DILIst) \n\nCompound\n\ncyclophosphamide \n\nDILIst Classification\n\nDILI Positive \n\nRoutes of Administration\n\nOral \n\nReferences\n\n[DOI:10.1016/j.drudis.2019.09.022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2019.09.022)\n\nFDA Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB)\n\n#### 12.1.5 Evidence for Carcinogenicity[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Evidence-for-Carcinogenicity&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nClassification of carcinogenicity: 1) evidence in humans: sufficient; 2) evidence in animals: sufficient.

Neutropenia has been reported in 2 infants whose mothers breastfed them while receiving cyclophosphamide. Most sources consider breastfeeding to be contraindicated during maternal cytotoxic antineoplastic drug therapy, especially alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide. Although some authors have suggested withholding breastfeeding for 1 to 3 days after a dose, the manufacturer recommends waiting for 1 week after the last dose before resuming breastfeeding.\n\nChemotherapy may adversely affect the normal microbiome and chemical makeup of breastmilk. Women who receive chemotherapy during pregnancy are more likely to have difficulty nursing their infant.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\nIn one 23-day-old infant, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and a low hemoglobin were possibly caused by cyclophosphamide after 3 days of maternal treatment with cyclophosphamide 6 mg/kg IV daily (total dose 300 mg).\n\nIn a 4-month-old, neutropenia was probably caused by cyclophosphamide in a mother 9 days after the last of 6 weekly doses of 800 mg cyclophosphamide intravenously, 2 mg [vincristine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vincristine) intravenously and daily doses of 30 mg of [prednisolone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/prednisolone) orally. Neutropenia persisted at least 12 days and was accompanied by a brief episode of diarrhea.\n\nA woman was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma at 27 weeks of pregnancy. Labor was induced at 34 4/7 weeks and treatment was begun with a standard regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, [doxorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin), [vincristine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vincristine), and [prednisone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/prednisone) in unspecified doses on a 21-day cycle, starting on day 2 postpartum. She pumped and discarded her milk and fed her infant donor milk for the first 10 days of each cycle and then breastfed her infant for the remaining 10 days before the next treatment cycle. The 10-day period of breastfeeding abstinence was determined by using about 3 half-lives of [vincristine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vincristine). After completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy, her infant was reportedly healthy and developing without any complications.\n\n◉ Effects on Lactation and Breastmilk\n\nA case of euprolactinemic galactorrhea was reported in a 55-year-old woman receiving cyclophosphamide for pemphigus vulgaris. One month after starting cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily she experienced fullness in both breasts and bilateral milky nipple discharge. No hormonal abnormalities were found. After cyclophosphamide was discontinued, her symptoms resolved completely and did not recur. Galactorrhea was probably caused by cyclophosphamide.\n\nTelephone follow-up study was conducted on 74 women who received cancer chemotherapy at one center during the second or third trimester of pregnancy to determine if they were successful at breastfeeding postpartum. Only 34% of the women were able to exclusively breastfeed their infants, and 66% of the women reported experiencing breastfeeding difficulties. This was in comparison to a 91% breastfeeding success rate in 22 other mothers diagnosed during pregnancy, but not treated with chemotherapy. Other statistically significant correlations included: 1. mothers with breastfeeding difficulties had an average of 5.5 cycles of chemotherapy compared with 3.8 cycles among mothers who had no difficulties; and 2. mothers with breastfeeding difficulties received their first cycle of chemotherapy on average 3.4 weeks earlier in pregnancy. Of the 56 women who received a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen, 34 had breastfeeding difficulties.\n\nDrugs and Lactation Database (LactMed)\n\n#### 12.1.8 Exposure Routes[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Exposure-Routes&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nThe substance can be absorbed into the body by ingestion and by inhalation of its aerosol. \n\nILO-WHO International Chemical Safety Cards (ICSCs)\n\nAfter oral administration, peak concentrations occur at one hour. \n\nToxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB)\n\n#### 12.1.9 Signs and Symptoms[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Signs-and-Symptoms&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nIngestion Exposure\n\nDiarrhoea.

Common adverse side effects reported in several studies and clinical trials involving the use of cyclophosphamide include hemorrhagic cystitis, amenorrhea, myelosuppression, alopecia, and spells of nausea and vomiting. Chronic or recurrent hemorrhagic cystitis is a side effect of particular clinical significance and may arise from the use of cyclophosphamide without adequate hydration or concurrent administration of [mesna](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mesna). The limiting factor in cyclophosphamide dosage in the treatment of neoplasms and immune-inflammatory conditions is urinary tract toxicity. The severity of hemorrhagic cystitis may vary from light pinkish to exsanguinating hemorrhage. Other urinary tract symptoms include increased urinary frequency and urgency due to urinary clot retention, nocturia, and dysuria.As previously outlined, [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein) is the principal-agent involved in the precipitation of hemorrhagic cystitis. The metabolite causes heightened vascular fragility and dilatation, irritation of the bladder mucosa, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and endogenous [nitric oxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20oxide) leading to hemorrhage. Prolonged exposure to [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein) may increase the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis. Due to the dose and time-dependent nature of the severity of this symptom, th recommendation is that the patient intake adequate fluids to force diuresis and reduce exposure of urothelium to [acrolein](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acrolein). Continuous bladder irrigation and [mesna](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mesna) use are also helpful in the management of drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.\n\nCyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression leading to the development of sepsis and septic shock. Antibiotic therapy and additional surveillance may be warranted at the discretion of the treatment team.There are also reports of cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, veno-occlusive liver disease, and secondary malignancies in some cases of cyclophosphamide use. Myocarditis, pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure are possible risks. Higher dosages of cyclophosphamide are associated with a greater incidence of these side effects and increased mortality.\n\nThe alkylating effects of cyclophosphamide may also affect the processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, leading to sterility in both sexes. The risk of sterility of time and dose-dependent and is irreversible in some patients. Sterility may manifest as amenorrhea in women and testicular atrophy in men. Patients should receive adequate education on the risks of infertility before initiation of cyclophosphamide therapy.\n\nStatPearls\n\n#### 12.1.11 Acute Effects[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Acute-Effects&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nChemIDplus\n\n#### 12.1.12 Interactions[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Interactions&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nPRIOR TREATMENT WITH [ALLOPURINOL](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ALLOPURINOL) SIGNIFICANTLY PROLONGS /THE HALF-LIFE OF CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE/.\n\nGilman, A.G., T.W.

Cell concentrations were 10,000 per dish for the osteosarcoma strain, 50,000 per dish for the HT 1080 strain, and 100,000 to 500,000 for the fresh cells. After a 1 hour exposure of the cells to the anticancer agent, [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) was added to the top layer for the subsequent 10 day to 3 week combined exposure. Treatment with 3.0 ug/ml (1/10 of the usual peak plasma concentration) cyclophosphamide alone showed colony inhibition of 14.2% in the OST strain and 8.5% in the HT 1080 strain. Addition of 0.2 mM [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) showed synergism, 27.8% and 56.2% inhibition, respectively. When 2 mM [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) was used with cyclophosphamide, colony inhibition was 57.1% in the OST strain. At a cyclophosphamide concentration of 0.3 ug/ml and either 0.2 or 2 mM [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine), synergism still was observed. Using fresh human tumor specimens with cyclophosphamide alone (3.0 ug/ml) 4 of 18 specimens showed positive sensitivity. With 2 mM [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) exposure in combination, 8 of 18 specimens (44.4%) showed a significant synergistic effect; of these, 7 showed positive sensitivity. An additive effect was observed in one specimen and a subadditive effect in 3 specimens. Continuous exposure to 0.2 mM [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) in combination resulted in significant synergism in specimens. For comparison, [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) alone at 0.2 mM produced colony inhibition of 9.2% (OST strain) and 12.5% (HT 10890 strain) in the cultured cells; at 2.0 mM, 15.0% (OST strain) and 100.0% (HT 1080 strain). In fresh sarcoma specimens, [caffeine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine) alone at 2 mM produced inhibition of 0.0% to 48.2% (mean, 19.1%) and there was no case with positive sensitivity.\n\n[PMID:2496063](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2496063)\n\nFull text: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5917686](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5917686)\n\nTomita K, Tsuchiya H; Jpn J Cancer Res 80 (1): 83-8 (1989)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nFor more Interactions (Complete) data for CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (29 total), please visit the [HSDB record page](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/hsdb/3047#section=Interactions-(Complete)).\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\n#### 12.1.13 Antidote and Emergency Treatment[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclophosphamide#section=Antidote-and-Emergency-Treatment&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nBasic treatment: Establish a patent airway.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.5 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates cyclophosphamide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclophosphamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced [hydroxyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyl) radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.5 hrs. Particulate-phase cyclophosphamide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Cyclophosphamide is sensitive to light. If released to soil, cyclophosphamide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 52. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Cyclophosphamide has shown to be non-biodegradable using sewage sludge tests. If released into [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water), cyclophosphamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The neutral hydrolysis calculated half-life for cyclophosphamide at 25 °C is 41 days. Occupational exposure to cyclophosphamide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclophosphamide is produced or used. Workers involved in formulating and dispensing the drug may be exposed through dermal contact (with the dry powder or solutions), or inhalation of dust. Direct human exposure occurs through ingestion of the drug (when dispensed in tablet form) and through injection (when administered intravenously).

INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Malignant Diseases Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of: • malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma • multiple myeloma • leukemias: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia (cyclophosphamide given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration) • mycosis fungoides (advanced disease) • neuroblastoma (disseminated disease) • adenocarcinoma of the ovary • retinoblastoma • carcinoma of the breast Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. 2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION During or immediately after the administration, adequate amounts of fluid should be ingested or infused to force diuresis in order to reduce the risk of urinary tract toxicity. Therefore, cyclophosphamide should be administered in the morning. 2.1 Dosing for Malignant Diseases Adults and Pediatric Patients Intravenous When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of cyclophosphamide for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 mg per kg to 50 mg per kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 mg per kg to 15 mg per kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 mg per kg to 5 mg per kg twice weekly. When cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide as well as that of the other drugs. 2.3 Preparation, Handling and Administration Handle and dispose of cyclophosphamide in a manner consistent with other cytotoxic drugs.1 Caution should be exercised when handling and preparing Cyclophosphamide Injection. To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear gloves when handling vials containing Cyclophosphamide Injection. Cyclophosphamide Injection Intravenous Administration Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Cyclophosphamide does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Use aseptic technique. For Direct Intravenous Injection Aseptically withdraw the prescribed dose from the vial. Dilute the prescribed dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection to a minimum concentration of 20 mg per mL by using any of the following diluents: • 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Do not use Sterile Water for Injection, USP because it results in a hypotonic solution and should not be injected directly. For Intravenous Infusion Aseptically withdraw the prescribed dose from the vial. Dilute the prescribed dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection to a minimum concentration of 2 mg per mL by using any of the following diluents. • 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP To reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions that appear to be administration rate-dependent (e.g., facial swelling, headache, nasal congestion, scalp burning), cyclophosphamide should be injected or infused very slowly. Duration of the infusion also should be appropriate for the volume and type of carrier fluid to be infused. Storage of Diluted Cyclophosphamide Solution: If not used immediately, for microbiological integrity, cyclophosphamide solutions should be stored as described in Table 1: Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Table 1: Storage of Cyclophosphamide Solutions Diluent Storage Room Temperature Refrigerated Diluted solutions (20 mg/mL) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs Up to 6 days 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs Up to 6 days 5% Dextrose Injection, USP up to 24 hrs Up to 6 days 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs Up to 6 days Diluted Solutions (2 mg/mL) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs Up to 6 days 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs up to 6 days 5% Dextrose Injection, USP up to 24 hrs up to 6 days 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium chloride Injection, USP up to 24 hrs up to 6 days After first use, the partially used vial should be stored in the refrigerator in the original carton at 2°C to 8°C (36ºF to 46°F). Should be used within 28 days and rest of the content need to be discarded. 3. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Cyclophosphamide Injection is a 200 mg/mL sterile clear colorless ready to dilute solution in a multiple-dose vial available in the following presentations: • 500 mg/2.5 mL • 1 g/5 mL 4. CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to it, any of its metabolites, or to other components of the product. Anaphylactic reactions including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents can occur. • Urinary Outflow Obstruction Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with urinary outflow obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated. Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤1,500/mm3 and platelets < 50,000/mm3. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. 5.2 Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity Hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, and hematuria have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Urotoxicity (bladder ulceration, necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruption of cyclophosphamide treatment or cystectomy. Urotoxicity can be fatal. Urotoxicity can occur with short-term or long-term use of cyclophosphamide. Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any urinary tract obstructions [see Contraindications (4)]. Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of urotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active urinary tract infections. Aggressive hydration with forced diuresis and frequent bladder emptying can reduce the frequency and severity of bladder toxicity. Mesna has been used to prevent severe bladder toxicity. 5.3 Cardiotoxicity Myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion including cardiac tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be fatal, have been reported with cyclophosphamide therapy. Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and flutter) and ventricular arrhythmias (including severe QT prolongation associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia) have been reported after treatment with regimens that included cyclophosphamide. The risk of cardiotoxicity may be increased with high doses of cyclophosphamide, in patients with advanced age, and in patients with previous radiation treatment to the cardiac region and/or previous or concomitant treatment with other cardiotoxic agents. Particular caution is necessary in patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and in patients with pre­ existing cardiac disease. Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Monitor patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and with pre-existing cardiac disease. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and other forms of pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure have been reported during and following treatment with cyclophosphamide. Late onset pneumonitis (greater than 6 months after start of cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased mortality. Pneumonitis may develop years after treatment with cyclophosphamide. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. 5.5 Secondary Malignancies Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. The risk of bladder cancer may be reduced by prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis. 5.6 Veno-occlusive Liver Disease Veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) including fatal outcome has been reported in patients receiving cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. A cytoreductive regimen in preparation for bone marrow transplantation that consists of cyclophosphamide in combination with whole-body irradiation, busulfan, or other agents has been identified as a major risk factor. VOD has also been reported to develop gradually in patients receiving long-term low-dose immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide. Other risk factors predisposing to the development of VOD include preexisting disturbances of hepatic function, previous radiation therapy of the abdomen, and a low performance status. 5.7 Alcohol Content The alcohol content in a dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Cyclophosphamide Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Cyclophosphamide Injection at 50 mg per kg delivers 0.155 g/kg of ethanol. For a 75 kg patient this would deliver 11.625 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other cyclophosphamide products may have a different amount of alcohol or no alcohol. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals, Cyclophosphamide Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and fetotoxic effects in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of Cyclophosphamide Injection. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for up to 1 year after completion Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda of therapy. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for 4 months after completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.9 Infertility Male and female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients being treated with Cyclophosphamide Injection. Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterility appears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients. Advise patients on the potential risks for infertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3 and 8.4)]. 5.10 Impairment of Wound Healing Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing. 5.11 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia associated with increased total body water, acute water intoxication, and a syndrome resembling SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone), which may be fatal, has been reported. 6.

DRUG INTERACTIONS Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug that is activated by cytochrome P450s [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An increase of the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites may occur with: • Protease inhibitors: Concomitant use of protease inhibitors may increase the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites. Use of protease inhibitor-based regimens was found to be associated with a higher Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Incidence of infections and neutropenia in patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE) than use of a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-based regimen. Combined or sequential use of cyclophosphamide and other agents with similar toxicities can potentiate toxicities. • Increased hematotoxicity and/or immunosuppression may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: • ACE inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can cause leukopenia. • Natalizumab • Paclitaxel: Increased hematotoxicity has been reported when cyclophosphamide was administered after paclitaxel infusion. • Thiazide diuretics • Zidovudine • Increased cardiotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: • Anthracyclines • Cytarabine • Pentostatin • Radiation therapy of the cardiac region • Trastuzumab • Increased pulmonary toxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: • Amiodarone • G-CSF, GM-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor): Reports suggest an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy that includes cyclophosphamide and G-CSF or GMCSF. • Increased nephrotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: • Amphotericin B • Indomethacin: Acute water intoxication has been reported with concomitant use of indomethacin • Increase in other toxicities: • Azathioprine: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver necrosis) • Busulfan: Increased incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and mucositis has been reported. • Protease inhibitors: Increased incidence of mucositis • Increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and past or concomitant radiation treatment. Etanercept: In patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, the addition of etanercept to standard treatment, including cyclophosphamide, was associated with a higher incidence of non-cutaneous malignant solid tumors. Metronidazole: Acute encephalopathy has been reported in a patient receiving cyclophosphamide and metronidazole. Causal association is unclear. In an animal study, the combination of cyclophosphamide with metronidazole was associated with increased cyclophosphamide toxicity. Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Coumarins: Both increased and decreased warfarin effect have been reported in patients receiving warfarin and cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporine: Lower serum concentrations of cyclosporine have been observed in patients receiving a combination of cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine than in patients receiving only cyclosporine. This interaction may result in an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease. Depolarizing muscle relaxants: Cyclophosphamide treatment causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Prolonged apnea may occur with concurrent depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine). If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, alert the anesthesiologist. 8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals, Cyclophosphamide Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause fetal malformations, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and toxic effects in the newborn [see Data]. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys [see Data]. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2%­ 4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Human Data Malformations of the skeleton, palate, limbs and eyes as well as miscarriage have been reported after exposure to cyclophosphamide in the first trimester. Fetal growth retardation and toxic effects manifesting in the newborn, including leukopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, severe bone marrow hypoplasia, and gastroenteritis have been reported after exposure to cyclophosphamide. Animal Data Administration of cyclophosphamide to pregnant mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses at or below the dose in patients based on body surface area resulted in various malformations, which included neural tube defects, limb and digit defects and other skeletal anomalies, cleft lip and palate, and reduced skeletal ossification. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Cyclophosphamide is present in breast milk. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, low hemoglobin, and diarrhea have been reported in infants breast fed by women treated with cyclophosphamide. Because of Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Cyclophosphamide Injection, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during the treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Cyclophosphamide Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Contraception Females Cyclophosphamide Injection can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Males Based on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for 4 months after completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Females Amenorrhea, transient or permanent, associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a proportion of women treated with cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few months after cessation of therapy. The risk of premature menopause with cyclophosphamide increases with age. Oligomenorrhea has also been reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. Animal data suggest an increased risk of failed pregnancy and malformations may persist after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide as long as oocytes/follicles exist that were exposed to cyclophosphamide during any of their maturation phases. The exact duration of follicular development in humans is not known but may be longer than 12 months [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Males Men treated with cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia which are normally associated with increased gonadotropin but normal testosterone secretion. 8.4 Pediatric Use Pre-pubescent girls treated with cyclophosphamide generally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and have regular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with apparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged cyclophosphamide treatment in late pre-pubescence has been reported. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide who have retained ovarian function after completing treatment are at increased risk of developing premature menopause. Pre-pubescent boys treated with cyclophosphamide develop secondary sexual characteristics normally, but may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increased gonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular atrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in some patients, though the reversibility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 8.5 Geriatric Use There is insufficient data from clinical studies of cyclophosphamide available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac functioning, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites. This may result in increased toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl =10 mL/min to 24 mL/min) for signs and symptoms of toxicity. Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. In patients requiring dialysis, use of a consistent interval between cyclophosphamide administration and dialysis should be considered. 8.7 Uses in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment have reduced conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active 4­ hydroxyl metabolite, potentially reducing efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The alcohol content of Cyclophosphamide Injection should be taken into account when given to patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 10. OVERDOSAGE No specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Overdosage should be managed with supportive measures, including appropriate treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should it occur. Serious consequences of overdosage include manifestations of dose dependent toxicities such as myelosuppression, urotoxicity, cardiotoxicity (including cardiac failure), veno-occlusive hepatic disease, and stomatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.6)]. Patients who received an overdose should be closely monitored for the development of toxicities, and hematologic toxicity in particular. Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable. Therefore, rapid hemodialysis is indicated when treating any suicidal or accidental overdose or intoxication. Cystitis prophylaxis with mesna may be helpful in preventing or limiting urotoxic effects with cyclophosphamide overdose. Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

The chemical name for cyclophosphamide is 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2­ oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate, and has the following structural formula: Cyclophosphamide has a molecular formula of C7H15Cl2N2O2P•H2O and a molecular weight of 279.1. Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol. Cyclophosphamide Injection is a 200 mg/mL sterile clear colorless solution available as 500 mg and 1 g strength vials. • 500 mg vial contains 534.5 mg cyclophosphamide monohydrate equivalent to 500 mg cyclophosphamide, 1.55 g Ethanol, 0.085 g Propylene Glycol, 0.085 g Polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.345 mg Monothioglycerol. • 1 g vial contains 1069.0 mg cyclophosphamide monohydrate equivalent to 1 g cyclophosphamide, 3.1 g Ethanol, 0.17 g Propylene Glycol, 0.17 g Polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.69 mg Monothioglycerol. 12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following IV administration, elimination half-life (t½) ranges from 3 to 12 hours with total body clearance (CL) values of 4 to 5.6 L/h. Pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range used clinically. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4.0 g/m2 over a 90 minutes infusion, saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination describe the kinetics of the drug. Distribution Approximately 20% of cyclophosphamide is protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are protein bound to an extent greater than 60%. Volume of distribution approximates total body water (30 to 50 L). Metabolism The liver is the major site of cyclophosphamide activation. Approximately 75% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, with 2B6 displaying the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo β-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. Less than 5% of cyclophosphamide may be directly detoxified by side chain oxidation, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide in patients. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. Auto-induction results in an increase in the total clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites and shortened t1/2 values following repeated administration at 12- to 24-hour interval. Elimination Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. 10 to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration. Special Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide were determined following one-hour intravenous infusion to renally impaired patients. The results demonstrated that the systemic exposure to cyclophosphamide increased as the renal function decreased. Mean dose-corrected AUC increased by 38% in the moderate renal group, (Creatinine clearance (CrCl of 25 to 50 mL/min), by 64% in the severe renal group (CrCl of 10 to 24 mL/min) and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CrCl of < 10mL/min) compared to the control group. The increase in exposure was significant in the severe group (p>0.05); thus, patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The dialyzability of cyclophosphamide was investigated in four patients on long-term hemodialysis. Dialysis clearance calculated by arterial-venous difference and actual drug recovery in dialysate averaged 104 mL/min, which is in the range of the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for the drug. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during hemodialysis. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction of the 6.5 hours to t1/2 reported in uremic patients. Reduction in t1/2, larger dialysis clearance than metabolic clearance, high extraction efficiency, and significant drug removal during dialysis, suggest that cyclophosphamide is dialyzable. Hepatic Impairment Total body clearance (CL) of cyclophosphamide is decreased by 40% in patients with severe hepatic impairment and elimination half-life (t½) is prolonged by 64%. Mean CL and t½ were 45 ± 8.6 L/kg and 12.5 ± 1.0 hours respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 63 ± 7.6 L/kg and 7.6 ± 1.4 hours respectively in the control group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Cyclophosphamide administered by different routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, or in drinking water, caused tumors in both mice and rats. In addition to leukemia and lymphoma, benign and malignant tumors were found at various tissue sites, including urinary bladder, mammary gland, lung, liver, and injection site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Reference ID: 4651533 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Cyclophosphamide was mutagenic and clastogenic in multiple in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies. Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic in male and female germ cells. Animal data indicate that exposure of oocytes to cyclophosphamide during follicular development may result in a decreased rate of implantations and viable pregnancies, and in an increased risk of malformations. Male mice and rats treated with cyclophosphamide show alterations in male reproductive organs (e.g., decreased weights, atrophy, changes in spermatogenesis), and decreases in reproductive potential (e.g., decreased implantations and increased post-implantation loss) and increases in fetal malformations when mated with untreated females [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. 15.

Zilovertamab vedotin is Merck’s investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). Global recruitment of the waveLINE-010 trial has begun, with patients now enrolling.\n\n“Following the encouraging results observed in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial, we look forward to evaluating the potential clinical benefits of a combination regimen with zilovertamab vedotin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to the current standard treatment,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “ADCs have shown promise as an important modality in the treatment of different cancer types, and the initiation of this Phase 3 waveLINE clinical trial demonstrates our commitment to researching zilovertamab vedotin to help address unmet needs for patients with this aggressive and most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.”\n\nWaveLINE-010 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, [NCT06717347](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06717347&esheet=54200472&newsitemid=20250206228342&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06717347&index=1&md5=76dc1ad0f49522f9d0c966e7a317e1bb) ), which is enrolling an estimated 1,046 patients globally. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints include complete response (CR) rate at the end of the treatment, overall survival, event-free survival, duration of CR and safety.\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 waveLINE-003 dose confirmation and expansion trial ([NCT05139017](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05139017&esheet=54200472&newsitemid=20250206228342&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05139017&index=2&md5=20c114cd22f07de7e0b26cedd70b1ca9)) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial ([NCT05406401](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05406401&esheet=54200472&newsitemid=20250206228342&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05406401&index=3&md5=3e096623794c420d15e8e911b43bc68d)) in combination with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL.

There are many subtypes of lymphoma, which is often categorized into two main types – Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of NHL, is derived from white blood cells that grow rapidly and uncontrollably, enlarging the lymph nodes and often migrating to other parts of the body. DLBCL accounts for approximately 25-30% of all NHLs worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL each year. The five-year relative survival rate for DLBCL is 60-70%.\n\n**About zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)**\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is an investigational ADC that targets ROR1. ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies. Merck is committed to research with zilovertamab vedotin across B-cell malignancies and is establishing a robust program of clinical trials under the name waveLINE. The waveLINE program includes a Phase 2/3 study in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (waveLINE-003, [NCT05139017](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05139017&esheet=54200472&newsitemid=20250206228342&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05139017&index=5&md5=65abaf9607954b4e1d57e10e17813923) ) and a Phase 2 study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (waveLINE-007, [NCT05406401](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05406401&esheet=54200472&newsitemid=20250206228342&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05406401&index=6&md5=ac9b49c6d18991b08a52559b1faf4f0e) ).\n\n**About Merck in hematology**\n\nMerck is committed to advancing innovation and care for people with hematologic neoplasms and malignancies.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Malignant Diseases Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of:  malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma  multiple myeloma  leukemias: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia (cyclophosphamide given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration)  mycosis fungoides (advanced disease)  neuroblastoma (disseminated disease)  adenocarcinoma of the ovary  retinoblastoma  carcinoma of the breast Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs. 1.2 Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome in Pediatric Patients: Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of biopsy proven minimal change nephrotic syndrome in pediatrics patients who failed to adequately respond to or are unable to tolerate adrenocorticosteroid therapy. Limitations of Use: The safety and effectiveness for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in adults or other renal disease has not been established. 2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION During or immediately after the administration, adequate amounts of fluid should be ingested or infused to force diuresis in order to reduce the risk of urinary tract toxicity. Therefore, cyclophosphamide should be administered in the morning. 2.1 Dosing for Malignant Diseases Adults and Pediatric Patients Intravenous When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of cyclophosphamide for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 mg per kg to 50 mg per kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 mg per kg to 15 mg per kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 mg per kg to 5 mg per kg twice weekly. Oral Oral cyclophosphamide dosing is usually in the range of 1 mg per kg per day to 5 mg per kg per day for both initial and maintenance dosing. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Many other regimens of intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. When cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide as well as that of the other drugs. 2.2 Dosing for Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome in Pediatric Patients An oral dose of 2 mg per kg daily for 8 to 12 weeks (maximum cumulative dose 168 mg per kg) is recommended. Treatment beyond 90 days increases the probability of sterility in males [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 2.3 Preparation, Handling and Administration Handle and dispose of cyclophosphamide in a manner consistent with other cytotoxic drugs.1 Caution should be exercised when handling and preparing Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP (lyophilized powder), or bottles containing cyclophosphamide tablets. To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear gloves when handling vials containing Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP (lyophilized powder), or bottles containing cyclophosphamide tablets. The coating of the cyclophosphamide tablets prevents direct contact of persons handling the tablets with the active substance. However, to prevent inadvertent exposure to the active substance, the cyclophosphamide tablets should not be cut, chewed, or crushed. Personnel should avoid exposure to broken tablets. If contact with broken tablets occurs, wash hands immediately and thoroughly. Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP Intravenous Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use cyclophosphamide vials if there are signs of melting. Melted cyclophosphamide is a clear or yellowish viscous liquid usually found as a connected phase or in droplets in the affected vials. Cyclophosphamide does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Use aseptic technique. For Direct Intravenous Injection Reconstitute Cyclophosphamide with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP only, using the volumes listed below in Table 1. Gently swirl the vial to dissolve the drug completely. Do not use Sterile Water for Injection, USP because it results in a hypotonic solution and should not be injected directly. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Table 1: Reconstitution for Direct Intravenous Injection Strength Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Cyclophosphamide Concentration 500 mg 25 mL 20 mg per mL 1 g 50 mL 2 g 100 mL For Intravenous Infusion Reconstitution of Cyclophosphamide: Reconstitute Cyclophosphamide using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Sterile Water for Injection, USP with the volume of diluent listed below in Table 2. Add the diluent to the vial and gently swirl to dissolve the drug completely. Table 2: Reconstitution in preparation for Intravenous Infusion Strength Volume of Diluent Cyclophosphamide Concentration 500 mg 25 mL 20 mg per mL 1 g 50 mL 2 g 100 mL Dilution of Reconstituted Cyclophosphamide: Further dilute the reconstituted Cyclophosphamide solution to a minimum concentration of 2 mg per mL with any of the following diluents:  5% Dextrose Injection, USP  5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP  0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP To reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions that appear to be administration rate-dependent (e.g., facial swelling, headache, nasal congestion, scalp burning), cyclophosphamide should be injected or infused very slowly. Duration of the infusion also should be appropriate for the volume and type of carrier fluid to be infused. Storage of Reconstituted and Diluted Cyclophosphamide Solution: If not used immediately, for microbiological integrity, cyclophosphamide solutions should be stored as described in Table 3: Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

CONTRAINDICATIONS  Hypersensitivity Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to it, any of its metabolites, or to other components of the product. Anaphylactic reactions including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents can occur.  Urinary Outflow Obstruction Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with urinary outflow obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated. Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤1,500/mm3 and platelets < 50,000/mm3. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. 5.2 Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity Hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, and hematuria have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Urotoxicity (bladder ulceration, necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruption of cyclophosphamide treatment or cystectomy. Urotoxicity can be fatal. Urotoxicity can occur with short-term or long-term use of cyclophosphamide. Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any urinary tract obstructions [see Contraindications (4)]. Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of urotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active urinary tract infections. Aggressive hydration with forced diuresis and frequent bladder emptying can reduce the frequency and severity of bladder toxicity. Mesna has been used to prevent severe bladder toxicity. 5.3 Cardiotoxicity Myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion including cardiac tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be fatal, have been reported with cyclophosphamide therapy Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and flutter) and ventricular arrhythmias (including severe QT prolongation associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia) have been reported after treatment with regimens that included cyclophosphamide. The risk of cardiotoxicity may be increased with high doses of cyclophosphamide, in patients with advanced age, and in patients with previous radiation treatment to the cardiac region and/or previous or concomitant treatment with other cardiotoxic agents. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Particular caution is necessary in patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and in patients with pre­ existing cardiac disease. Monitor patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and with pre-existing cardiac disease. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and other forms of pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure have been reported during and following treatment with cyclophosphamide. Late onset pneumonitis (greater than 6 months after start of cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased mortality. Pneumonitis may develop years after treatment with cyclophosphamide. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. 5.5 Secondary Malignancies Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. The risk of bladder cancer may be reduced by prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis. 5.6 Veno-occlusive Liver Disease Veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) including fatal outcome has been reported in patients receiving cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. A cytoreductive regimen in preparation for bone marrow transplantation that consists of cyclophosphamide in combination with whole-body irradiation, busulfan, or other agents has been identified as a major risk factor. VOD has also been reported to develop gradually in patients receiving long-term low-dose immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide. Other risk factors predisposing to the development of VOD include preexisting disturbances of hepatic function, previous radiation therapy of the abdomen, and a low performance status. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and fetotoxic effects in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Infertility Male and female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients being treated with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterility appears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients. Advise patients on the potential risks for infertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 and 8.6)]. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5.9 Impairment of Wound Healing Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia associated with increased total body water, acute water intoxication, and a syndrome resembling SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone), which may be fatal, has been reported. 6.

DRUG INTERACTIONS Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug that is activated by cytochrome P450s [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An increase of the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites may occur with:  Protease inhibitors: Concomitant use of protease inhibitors may increase the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites. Use of protease inhibitor-based regimens was found to be associated with a higher Incidence of infections and neutropenia in patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE) than use of a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-based regimen. Combined or sequential use of cyclophosphamide and other agents with similar toxicities can potentiate toxicities.  Increased hematotoxicity and/or immunosuppression may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:  ACE inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can cause leukopenia.  Natalizumab  Paclitaxel: Increased hematotoxicity has been reported when cyclophosphamide was administered after paclitaxel infusion.  Thiazide diuretics  Zidovudine Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda  Increased cardiotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:  Anthracyclines  Cytarabine  Pentostatin  Radiation therapy of the cardiac region  Trastuzumab  Increased pulmonary toxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:  Amiodarone  G-CSF, GM-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor): Reports suggest an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy that includes cyclophosphamide and G-CSF or GMCSF.  Increased nephrotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:  Amphotericin B  Indomethacin: Acute water intoxication has been reported with concomitant use of indomethacin  Increase in other toxicities:  Azathioprine: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver necrosis)  Busulfan: Increased incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and mucositis has been reported.  Protease inhibitors: Increased incidence of mucositis  Increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and past or concomitant radiation treatment. Etanercept: In patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis, the addition of etanercept to standard treatment, including cyclophosphamide, was associated with a higher incidence of non-cutaneous malignant solid tumors. Metronidazole: Acute encephalopathy has been reported in a patient receiving cyclophosphamide and metronidazole. Causal association is unclear. In an animal study, the combination of cyclophosphamide with metronidazole was associated with increased cyclophosphamide toxicity. Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Coumarins: Both increased and decreased warfarin effect have been reported in patients receiving warfarin and cyclophosphamide. Cyclosporine: Lower serum concentrations of cyclosporine have been observed in patients receiving a combination of cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine than in patients receiving only cyclosporine. This interaction may result in an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease. Depolarizing muscle relaxants: Cyclophosphamide treatment causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Prolonged apnea may occur with concurrent depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine). If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, alert the anesthesiologist. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause fetal malformations, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and toxic effects in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Human Data Malformations of the skeleton, palate, limbs and eyes as well as miscarriage have been reported after exposure to cyclophosphamide in the first trimester. Fetal growth retardation and toxic effects manifesting in the newborn, including leukopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, severe bone marrow hypoplasia, and gastroenteritis have been reported after exposure to cyclophosphamide. Animal Data Administration of cyclophosphamide to pregnant mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses at or below the dose in patients based on body surface area resulted in various malformations, which included neural tube defects, limb and digit defects and other skeletal anomalies, cleft lip and palate, and reduced skeletal ossification. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Cyclophosphamide is present in breast milk. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, low hemoglobin, and diarrhea have been reported in infants breast fed by women treated with cyclophosphamide. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cyclophosphamide, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Pre-pubescent girls treated with cyclophosphamide generally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and have regular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with apparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged cyclophosphamide treatment in late pre-pubescence has been reported. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide who have retained ovarian function after completing treatment are at increased risk of developing premature menopause. Pre-pubescent boys treated with cyclophosphamide develop secondary sexual characteristics normally, but may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increased gonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular atrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in some patients, though the reversibility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is insufficient data from clinical studies of cyclophosphamide available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac functioning, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Pregnancy should be avoided during treatment with cyclophosphamide because of the risk of fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Female patients of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception during and for up to 1 year after completion of treatment. Male patients who are sexually active with female partners who are or may become pregnant should use a condom during and for at least 4 months after treatment. Infertility Females Amenorrhea, transient or permanent, associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a proportion of women treated with cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few months after cessation of therapy. The risk of premature menopause with cyclophosphamide increases with age. Oligomenorrhea has also been reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. Animal data suggest an increased risk of failed pregnancy and malformations may persist after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide as long as oocytes/follicles exist that were exposed to cyclophosphamide during any of their maturation phases. The exact duration of follicular development in humans is not known, but may be longer than 12 months [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Males Men treated with cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia which are normally associated with increased gonadotropin but normal testosterone secretion. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites. This may result in increased toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl =10 mL/min to 24 mL/min) for signs and symptoms of toxicity. Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. In patients requiring dialysis, use of a consistent interval between cyclophosphamide administration and dialysis should be considered. 8.8 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment have reduced conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active 4­ hydroxyl metabolite, potentially reducing efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10. OVERDOSAGE No specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Overdosage should be managed with supportive measures, including appropriate treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should it occur. Serious consequences of overdosage include manifestations of dose dependent toxicities such as myelosuppression, urotoxicity, cardiotoxicity (including cardiac failure), veno-occlusive hepatic disease, and stomatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.6)]. Patients who received an overdose should be closely monitored for the development of toxicities, and hematologic toxicity in particular. Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable. Therefore, rapid hemodialysis is indicated when treating any suicidal or accidental overdose or intoxication. Cystitis prophylaxis with mesna may be helpful in preventing or limiting urotoxic effects with cyclophosphamide overdose. 11.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following IV administration, elimination half-life (t ½) ranges from 3 to 12 hours with total body clearance (CL) values of 4 to 5.6 L/h. Pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range used clinically. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4.0 g/m2 over a 90 minutes infusion, saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination describe the kinetics of the drug. Absorption After oral administration, peak concentrations of cyclophosphamide occurred at one hour. Area under the curve ratio for the drug after oral and IV administration (AUCpo : AUCiv) ranged from 0.87 to 0.96. Distribution Approximately 20% of cyclophosphamide is protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are protein bound to an extent greater than 60%. Volume of distribution approximates total body water (30 to 50 L). Metabolism The liver is the major site of cyclophosphamide activation. Approximately 75% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, with 2B6 displaying the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo β-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. Less than 5% of cyclophosphamide may be directly detoxified by side chain oxidation, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide in patients. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. Auto-induction results in an increase in the total clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites and shortened t1/2 values following repeated administration at 12- to 24-hour interval. Elimination Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. 10 to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration. Special Populations Renal Impairment Reference ID: 3304966 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide were determined following one-hour intravenous infusion to renally impaired patients. The results demonstrated that the systemic exposure to cyclophosphamide increased as the renal function decreased. Mean dose-corrected AUC increased by 38% in the moderate renal group, (Creatinine clearance (CrCl of 25 to 50 mL/min), by 64% in the severe renal group (CrCl of 10 to 24 mL/min) and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CrCl of < 10mL/min) compared to the control group. The increase in exposure was significant in the severe group (p>0.05); thus, patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The dialyzability of cyclophosphamide was investigated in four patients on long-term hemodialysis. Dialysis clearance calculated by arterial-venous difference and actual drug recovery in dialysate averaged 104 mL/min, which is in the range of the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for the drug. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during hemodialysis. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction of the 6.5 hours to t1/2 reported in uremic patients. Reduction in t1/2, larger dialysis clearance than metabolic clearance, high extraction efficiency, and significant drug removal during dialysis, suggest that cyclophosphamide is dialyzable. Hepatic Impairment Total body clearance (CL) of cyclophosphamide is decreased by 40% in patients with severe hepatic impairment and elimination half-life (t½) is prolonged by 64%. Mean CL and t½ were 45 ± 8.6 L/kg and 12.5 ± 1.0 hours respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 63 ± 7.6 L/kg and 7.6 ± 1.4 hours respectively in the control group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. 13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Cyclophosphamide administered by different routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, or in drinking water, caused tumors in both mice and rats. In addition to leukemia and lymphoma, benign and malignant tumors were found at various tissue sites, including urinary bladder, mammary gland, lung, liver, and injection site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cyclophosphamide was mutagenic and clastogenic in multiple in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies. Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic in male and female germ cells. Animal data indicate that exposure of oocytes to cyclophosphamide during follicular development may result in a decreased rate of implantations and viable pregnancies, and in an increased risk of malformations. Male mice and rats treated with cyclophosphamide show alterations in male reproductive organs (e.g., decreased weights, atrophy, changes in spermatogenesis), and decreases in reproductive potential (e.g., decreased implantations and increased post-implantation loss) and increases in fetal malformations when mated with untreated females [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 15.
