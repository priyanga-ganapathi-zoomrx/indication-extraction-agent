There are two main types of HSCT. This includes autologous HSCT, for which the stem cells are obtained from the patient, and allogeneic HSCT, for which the stem cells are obtained from a related or unrelated donor. The most common indications for autologous stem cell transplant are multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory lymphoma, whereas leukemia and bone marrow failure syndromes remain the most common indications for allogeneic stem cell transplant. This chapter will review the different types, indications, processes, and main complications of HSCT. This chapter will also discuss end-of-life issues that patients and providers face when transplant patients are admitted for the intensive care unit.\n\n**Keywords:** Stem cell transplant, Bone marrow transplant, Transplant, Autologous, Allogeneic, Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Veno-occlusive disease (VOD), Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), Idiopathic pulmonary syndrome\n\n## Introduction\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains one of the only potentially curative therapies for some patients with both benign and malignant blood disorders. The concept of HSCT was first recognized in the 1950s in animal models as a means of marrow recovery following lethal doses of total body irradiation [[14](#CR14)]. This concept was then reported by Thomas et al. in 1957 in human patients with leukemia [[43](#CR43), [72](#CR72)–[74](#CR74)]. Today, HSCT has broad indications which have expanded to include both benign and malignant conditions.\n\n## Types of Transplant\n\nHSCT can be categorized into two main types, autologous and allogeneic. A summary of the key differences in these types of transplants is provided in Fig. [1](#Fig1).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/9218ce3d4420/460769_1_En_99_Fig1_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7121262_460769_1_En_99_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/9218ce3d4420/460769_1_En_99_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nSummary of the types of HSCT\n\nAutologous HSCT involves the use of the patient’s own stem cells to rescue the bone marrow following the administration of high-dose (myeloablative) chemotherapy. The aim of this type of transplant is to eradicate residual cancer cells that have demonstrated intermediate resistance to standard doses of chemotherapy. Cytotoxicity is the main benefit of this type of transplant because there is no immune attack against the cancer cells. Relapsed/aggressive lymphoma and multiple myeloma remain the primary indications for autologous HSCT [[18](#CR18)]. However, the use of this type of transplant has also extended to autoimmune diseases. A comprehensive list of the potential indications for autologous stem cell transplant is provided in Table [1](#Tab1).\n\n### Table 1.\n\nDiseases commonly treated with autologous HSCT [[15](#CR15)]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Hematological malignancies** |\n| Multiple myeloma |\n| Light chain amyloidosis |\n| Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma |\n| Hodgkin’s lymphoma |\n| Acute myeloid leukemia |\n| **Solid tumors** |\n| Neuroblastoma |\n| Germ cell tumors |\n| **Other diseases** |\n| Autoimmune disorders (i.e., scleroderma) |\n\nAllogeneic HSCT involves the infusion of stem cells from a related or unrelated donor resulting in two mechanisms for fighting the cancer. The mechanisms of disease eradication include both the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapy and the donor’s immune system to attack residual cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). In addition to eliminating residual cancer cells, the chemotherapy administered in an allogeneic stem cell transplant is used to also suppress the recipient’s immune system to prevent rejection of the donor cells (graft). Patients typically receive additional immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (i.e., tacrolimus, sirolimus), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®), and/or other drugs (methotrexate, anti-thymocyte globulin) to both prevent rejection of the graft and protect normal recipient/host cells from being attacked by the graft which is known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes remain the most common indications for allogeneic HSCT [[18](#CR18)]. However, advanced chronic leukemias, lymphomas, and hemoglobinopathies are also treated with this type of transplantation. A more comprehensive list of indications for allogeneic HSCT is provided in Table [2](#Tab2).\n\n### Table 2.\n\nDiseases commonly treated with allogeneic HSCT [[15](#CR15)]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Hematologic malignancies** |\n| Acute myeloid leukemia |\n| Acute lymphoblastic leukemia |\n| Chronic myeloid leukemia |\n| Myelodysplastic syndromes |\n| Myeloproliferative disorders |\n| Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma |\n| Hodgkin’s lymphoma |\n| Chronic lymphocytic leukemia |\n| Multiple myeloma |\n| **Other diseases** |\n| Aplastic anemia |\n| Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria |\n| Fanconi’s anemia |\n| Blackfan-Diamond anemia |\n| Thalassemia major |\n| Sickle cell anemia |\n| Severe combined immunodeficiency |\n| Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome |\n| Inborn errors of metabolism (i.e., Gaucher’s disease) |\n\nAllogeneic HSCT is one of the first examples of immunotherapy in oncology because of its ability to use the donors immune system as a means of fighting cancer. In addition to changing the hematopoietic progenitor cells, a change in recipient’s with donor’s immune system occurs. Cellular therapy builds on the foundation of collection and infusion of hematopoietic cells used for anti-cancer therapy. The therapeutic immunologic effect of the graft was first described in the field of allogeneic stem cell transplant in the 1950s as a graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). The GVLeffect is identified following observations of a decrease in relapse rate in leukemia patients who developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplant and further supported by the increased relapse rate seen after syngeneic transplants and transplants using T-cell-depleted grafts [[80](#CR80)]. The GVL effect, caused mostly by donor lymphocytes, prompted to the use of donor lymphocyte infusions as one of the earlier forms of cellular therapy subsequently modified genetically to be antigen specific [i.e., chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cells], to target different types of leukemias, lymphoma, and other malignances.\n\n## Overview of the Transplant Process\n\nRegardless of the type of transplant, patients receiving HSCT undergo a similar process that is centered around the day of stem cell infusion, which is known as “Day 0.” The days prior to transplant are designated with a minus sign. Thus, Day −10 would represent 10 days prior to the planned infusion of the stem cells. The days after infusion of the stem cells are designated with a plus sign such that Day +30 would indicate that the patient is 30 days post infusion of stem cells. The transplant process starts with a referral or consultation by the stem cell transplant team, which initiates the process for insurance/financial clearance, assessment of comorbidities/organ function, and evaluation of the functional status of the patient and decision on what type of transplant is indicated. This process typically takes 2–3 months and will occur concomitantly with the primary or salvage therapy for management of the disease. Once the patient is both clinically suitable and financially approved, arrangements are made to collect the stem cells either via apheresis in the case of both autologous and allogeneic HSCT or bone marrow harvest in select cases of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe actual transplant process begins with the patient receiving conditioning chemotherapy, which is known also as the preparative regimen. In general, the pretransplant conditioning regimens consist of a combination of chemotherapy drugs with or without radiation with the goal to immunosuppress the recipient and eliminate as much tumor as possible. These regimens are classified as myeloablative, non-myeloablative, or reduced intensity. Myeloablative regimens are defined by their ability to eradicate the recipient’s bone marrow with associated profound cytopenia and lack of autologous hematopoietic recovery. Non-myeloablative (NMA) regimens typically cause minimal cytopenia and relying primarily on a GVL effect for disease eradication. Reduced-intensity protocols are an intermediate intensity group of regimens, a middle of the road between ablative and NMA conditioning [[5](#CR5)]. The preferred preparative regimen is dependent upon a combination of disease- and patient-related factors. The conditioning regimen is typically administered between Day −10 and Day −2 with a day of “rest” prior to the stem cell infusion to allow for clearance of the cytotoxic chemotherapy, thereby avoiding potential damage to the infused stem cells. On “Day 0,” the stem cells are infused into the patient via a central venous catheter.\n\nIn the case of allogeneic stem cell transplant, patients also receive immunosuppressant therapy that is typically started a few days prior to the infusion of stem cells and often continued for up to 6 months posttransplant. All patients receive a combination of antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral prophylactic therapy. The pretransplant process ends with the infusion of the stem cells and is summarized in Fig. [2](#Fig2).\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n[![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/5be8e575c959/460769_1_En_99_Fig2_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7121262_460769_1_En_99_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/5be8e575c959/460769_1_En_99_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\nSummary of pre-HSCT process\n\nThe next phase of transplant is commonly known as the recovery period and begins after the infusion of the stem cells. For patients who undergo autologous HSCT, this period will typically last about 6 months culminating with the administration of vaccines. For allogeneic HSCT, this period may last longer dependent upon whether the patient develops graft-versus-host disease or other transplant-related complications discussed later in this chapter. In both autologous and allogeneic HSCT, the recovery period is associated with approximately 2–4 weeks of myelosuppression from the conditioning chemotherapy regimen. It is during this time that the donor cells migrate to the bone marrow and begin to produce new blood cells. Patients may require transfusion of blood products during this time and are at greatest risk for bacterial, fungal, and certain viral infections due to low neutrophil counts and potential mucosal damage from mucositis. The extent of immunosuppression during this time is determined by the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen. Immunosuppression may be more prolonged in allogeneic HSCT due to the use of steroids and other immunosuppressant medications for the treatment of GVHD. The post-HSCT process is summarized in Fig. [3](#Fig3).\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n[![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/18e913985e95/460769_1_En_99_Fig3_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7121262_460769_1_En_99_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dbe5/7121262/18e913985e95/460769_1_En_99_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\nSummary of the recovery period\n\n## Complications After Autologous HSCT\n\nWith appropriate patient selection, autologous HSCT is generally considered a well-tolerated procedure with an estimated transplant-related mortality (TRM) of less than 3% within the first 100 days posttransplant [[35](#CR35)]. In fact, the most common cause of death after autologous HSCT remains disease relapse accounting for up to 69% of such deaths [[35](#CR35)].\n\nThe use of myeloablative chemotherapy for autologous HSCT results in profound pancytopenia, which puts the patient at risk for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Patients tend to be at greatest risk for bacterial infections in the early posttransplant period (prior to neutrophil engraftment), although other infections like viral or fungal can also occur during this time period. The estimated rate of admission to the ICU after autologous HSCT remains low with one study of 1013 patients showing a rate of only 3.3% [[11](#CR11)]. The overall mortality of all patients in the cohort was 1%. However, this increased to 38% for those patients admitted to the ICU [[11](#CR11)]. The most common reasons for ICU admission were systemic inflammatory response/sepsis (32%), respiratory failure (29%), and cardiovascular failure (26%) [[11](#CR11)]. The majority of patients had an underlying diagnosis of multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis (85%) with the greatest disease-specific ICU mortality associated with AL amyloidosis patients (54.5%) [[11](#CR11)]. The study also found a correlation between mortality and both the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score in the first 24 h of ICU admission suggesting possible tools to assist in clinical decision-making regarding the continuation of intensive care delivered after 24 h of ICU admission [[77](#CR77)].\n\nIn addition to infectious complications , many of the patients undergoing autologous HSCT will develop gastrointestinal complications from the preparative chemotherapy regimen. The two most common preparative regimens for autologous HSCT are single-agent melphalan (primarily used for plasma cell disorders) and the combination of BCNU/carmustine, etoposide, Ara-C/cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) (primarily used for lymphomas). These regimens are considered myeloablative and may result in varying degrees of damage to the GI tract mucosa with mucositis, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, altered taste, and a period of anorexia. Neutropenia lasts for 1–2 weeks and may be associated with neutropenic fever and bacteremia, requiring broad antimicrobial coverage, occasional sepsis, and need for ICU care. In addition, older patients may be more prone to cardiac toxicity and development of atrial fibrillation, especially if there is a history of atrial fibrillation, and renal insufficiency or volume overload. However, most of these effects tend to resolve within a short period of time after neutrophil engraftment has occurred.\n\nLate effects of autologous HSCT are relatively uncommon with second primary malignancies, obstructive/restrictive lung impairment, and viral infections being the most reported late complications. A study of 1617 lymphoma survivors found a cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms of 6.5% [[46](#CR46)]. The most common type of neoplasm was a hematologic malignancy (43.8%), which included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative disorder (MPN), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) [[46](#CR46)]. A study of lymphoma patients in Japan reported an incidence of MDS and AML of 1.8% for long-term survivors after autologous HSCT. However, there was increased concern for patients with multiple myeloma who were found in trials of maintenance therapy after autologous HSCT to have an incidence of secondary malignancies of 8–14% when receiving maintenance versus 4–5% without maintenance therapy [[3](#CR3), [31](#CR31), [44](#CR44)].\n\nWhile pulmonary complications of autologous HSCT seem to be rare, Stenehjem et al. have reported an incidence of 11.5% and 5.8% for obstructive and restrictive lung impairment, respectively, in 226 lymphoma survivors after autologous HSCT [[69](#CR69)]. Current smoking and cumulative doxorubicin dose of 400–775 mg/m2 were risk factors for obstructive disease, while chest radiation greater than 13–66 Gy seemed to increase the risk for restrictive lung disease and pulmonary complications [[69](#CR69)].\n\nLastly, patients receiving an autologous HSCT remain at risk for viral and atypical infections (i.e., varicella-zoster virus and *Pneumocystis jirovecii*) for several months post-engraftment while awaiting recovery of the lymphocyte population, which usually reaches a safer level by 100 days posttransplant [[51](#CR51), [75](#CR75)]. It is for this reason that many patients will remain on prophylactic medications like acyclovir or valacyclovir, Bactrim, Mepron, or pentamidine for 3–6 months after transplant. Patients are also recommended to undergo repeat vaccination for measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, *Haemophilus influenzae*, polio, and influenza, which typically begins at 6 months after the transplant [[75](#CR75)].\n\n## Complications of Allogeneic HSCT\n\nComplications of allogeneic HSCT are generally secondary to chemotherapy side effects, prolonged immunosuppression, or immune-related effects of the donor cells. Unlike with autologous HSCT, there is also a higher risk for graft failure/rejection and higher non-relapse mortality (NRM). Overall NRM after allogeneic HSCT has improved significantly over time due to better HLA typing, improvements in patient selection, and supportive care [[27](#CR27), [28](#CR28), [32](#CR32)].\n\nThe use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, growth factors, preemptive antiviral therapy, and peripheral blood stem cells have contributed to better transplant outcomes. Furthermore, the use of predictive tools in the upfront selection process seems to be beneficial with many US centers incorporating a standardized HSCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) to help in the selection of patients for transplant. The HCT-CI utilizes weighted scores for the presence of a variety of comorbidities to help predict non-relapse mortality. The comorbidities include active gastrointestinal disease, coagulopathy, endocrine disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer, asthma, obesity, infection, psychiatric disturbances, heart valve disease, and prior solid tumor. The HCT-CI yields a calculated score between 0 and 26 allowing for patients to be classified into one of three groups: low risk (score of 0), intermediate risk (score of 1–2), or high risk (score of 3 or higher). Patients with low, intermediate, and high risk have an estimated 2-year non-relapse mortality of 14%, 19–22%, and approximately 40%, respectively [[67](#CR67)]. HCT-CI has also been shown to be a valid tool in predicting outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic HSCT who subsequently require critical care. In a single institution review of 377 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 100 days of allogeneic HSCT, Bayraktar et al. [[8](#CR8)] showed that patients with HCT-CI values ≥2 had significantly higher inpatient mortality than patients with values of 0–1 and that HCT-CI values ≥4 were significantly associated with shorter OS compared with values of 0–1 (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.23–2.47). Factors associated with lower inpatient mortality were ICU admission during the conditioning phase of the transplant and use of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. The overall inpatient mortality rate was 64%, and the 1-year OS rate was 15%. Among patients with HCT-CI scores of 0–1, 2, 3, and 4, the 1-year OS rates were 22%, 17%, 18%, and 9%, respectively.\n\nComplications of allogeneic HSCTare generally categorized as early and late effects. Early effects include primarily issues that occur within the first 100 days of the transplant. This can be further divided into three time periods: pre-engraftment, early post-engraftment, and late post-engraftment (>100 days post-HSCT).\n\n### Pre-engraftment Complications\n\nDuring the pre-engraftment period, most patients will start to experience side effects of the conditioning chemotherapy regimen. This includes primarily nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. Fever and infection are also common during this time with gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, herpes simplex virus, respiratory viruses, enteric viruses, and fungal infections (especially *Candida* and *Aspergillus* species) being most prevalent.\n\n### Early Post-engraftment Complications\n\nThe early post-engraftment period is defined as the time of engraftment through Day +100. During this time, the risk for bacterial infections tends to gradually decline. However, patients tend to develop an increased risk for viral infections, immune-mediated effects of the donor cells, and noninfectious pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and liver toxicities. Patients also continue to have significant anemia and thrombocytopenia in the early post-engraftment period, which tends to persist for roughly 30–60 days posttransplant.\n\nImmunosuppressive medications are often continued for up to 6 months posttransplant but may be continued longer in those patients who develop graft-versus-host disease. Immunosuppression during the early post-engraftment time can result in a prolonged period of increased risk for infection while awaiting reconstitution of the mature, functional lymphocyte population. It is for this reason that allogeneic HSCT patients tend to be at increased risk for atypical viral and fungal infections. There is also another peak in the risk for *Aspergillus* infections along with the potential for pneumocystis infection. Table [3](#Tab3) lists some of the common organisms and manifestations of viral infections seen in allogeneic HSCT patients.\n\n#### Table 3.\n\nSummary of viral infections in allogeneic HSCT recipients\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| CMV |\n| Pneumonitis |\n| Esophagitis |\n| Colitis |\n| Hepatitis |\n| Encephalitis |\n| Chorioretinitis |\n| Varicella zoster |\n| Rash (shingles) |\n| Encephalitis |\n| Herpes simplex virus (HSV) |\n| Mucosal ulcerations from reactivation |\n| BK virus |\n| Hemorrhagic cystitis |\n| Nephropathy |\n| Adenovirus |\n| Pneumonitis |\n| Hepatitis |\n| Gastritis/colitis |\n| Cystitis |\n| Nephritis |\n| Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) |\n| Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) |\n| Human herpesvirus (HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8) |\n| Pneumonitis |\n| Encephalitis |\n| Rash |\n| Fever |\n| Marrow suppression |\n| JC virus |\n| Multifocal leukoencephalopathy |\n| Common respiratory viruses |\n| Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) |\n| Human metapneumovirus |\n| Parainfluenza viruses (most commonly parainfluenza virus 3) |\n| Influenza virus |\n| Rhinovirus and enterovirus |\n| Coronavirus |\n| Bocavirus |\n\nEarly noninfectious complications after allogeneic HSCT include fluid overload, acute GVHD, liver complications, pulmonary complications – idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage – and hemorrhagic cystitis.\n\nFluid overload is a common complication of allogeneic HSCT. In a retrospective, single institution study of 594 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, Rondon et al. [[59](#CR59)] identified a syndrome of “fluid overload” that occurred early posttransplant in the absence of other known transplant complications. This was characterized by the degree of weight gain and edema necessitating fluid removal with or without organ toxicity. The study proposed the following grading system for fluid overload: grade 1, weight gain <10% from baseline, asymptomatic or mild edema, possibly requiring diuretic therapy or a decrease in intravenous fluid replacement; grade 2, symptomatic fluid retention, with or without weight gain ≥10–<20% from baseline, requiring ongoing diuretic therapy; grade 3, weight gain ≥20% from baseline, not responding to diuretic therapy, with possible renal, pulmonary, or cardiac dysfunction requiring further treatment; and grade 4, progressive dysfunction of more than 1 organ system or requiring intensive care. The study included two cohorts. The first was a study cohort of 145 patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT with melphalan-fludarabine-based conditioning regimens. Fluid overload occurred in 66.2% of this cohort with multivariant analysis showing that grade ≥2 (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 3.4–50; *P* <0.001) and serum creatinine level >1 mg/dL at transplantation admission (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1–11; *P* = 0.03) were significantly associated with Day +100 non-relapse mortality. This was validated in a cohort of 449 AML/MDS patients undergoing transplant from an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor following a busulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning regimen.\n\nAcute GVHD remains a significant cause of early transplant-related mortality. In the acute setting, GVHD is felt to be primarily a T-cell-driven process that is initiated by tissue damage from the conditioning regimen followed by donor T-cell activation and the associated inflammatory response. Risk factors for acute GVHD include but are not limited to increased donor-recipient HLA disparity/mismatch, increased donor age, multiparity (female donors), use of peripheral blood stem cells, and myeloablative conditioning. Acute GVHD can affect multiple organs with the most common being the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. The skin is the most commonly affected organ in acute GVHD. It typically consists of a maculopapular rash that may be pruritic or even painful. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement is typically categorized as upper or lower and is based upon clinical symptoms that may be supported by a tissue diagnosis or biopsy. Upper GI GVHD typically presents with nausea and anorexia, whereas lower GI tract involvement typically presents as profuse watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping. Liver involvement is less common but typically presents with a cholestatic picture [[81](#CR81)].\n\nProphylaxis against acute GVHD is aimed at decreasing the expansion and activation of donor T-cells. This can be accomplished through manipulation of the graft to deplete the T-cell population or with pharmacologic agents (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, and the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus or sirolimus). Front-line treatment of acute GVHD involves the use of high doses of corticosteroids, which may further suppress the patient’s immune system, thereby increasing the risk for infection.\n\nLiver disease after HSCT has multiple potential etiologies with many of the problems presenting within the first 100 days of transplant. Reactivation of viral hepatitis, fatty liver, iron overload, and acute drug toxicity are likely the most common causes of abnormal liver function tests during transplant. But the acute onset of ascites, weight gain, fluid retention, and/or rising bilirubin should prompt the concern for veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). VOD/SOS is thought to be the result of pre-existing damage to hepatic venous endothelial cells leading to a procoagulant state leading to deposition of fibrinogen and factor VIII within the venular walls and liver sinusoids. This leads to progressive venular occlusion followed by deposition of collagen in the sinusoids, sclerosis of venular walls, fibrosis of venular lumens, and occlusion of terminal hepatic venules and intercalated veins [[22](#CR22), [34](#CR34), [61](#CR61)–[65](#CR65), [71](#CR71)]. Pre-existing liver disease combined with exposure to high-dose alkylating agents seems to pose the highest risk for the development of VOD/SOS [[45](#CR45)]. Commonly used criteria for the diagnosis of this condition are summarized in Table [4](#Tab4). Doppler ultrasound of the liver and liver biopsy may be necessary to differentiate VOD/SOS from acute GVHD of the liver. One of the most promising therapies for VOD/SOS is defibrotide, which is a polydeoxyribonucleotide adenosine receptor agonist that has been shown to affect endothelial cell function through the release of prostanoids, increase in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), decrease levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and inhibit leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [[30](#CR30), [81](#CR81)]. Studies of defibrotide have shown complete response rates of 30–60%, including the treatment of patients with severe VOD/SOS [[11](#CR11), [13](#CR13), [16](#CR16), [17](#CR17), [56](#CR56)–[58](#CR58), [70](#CR70)].\n\n#### Table 4.\n\nClinical criteria for diagnosis of VOD/SOS\n\n| Modified seattle criteria [[45](#CR45)] | Baltimore criteria [[36](#CR36)] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Two or more of the following within 20 days of HSCT | Bilirubin >2 mg/dL plus at least two of the following |\n| Serum total bilirubin >2 mg/dL | Hepatomegaly |\n| Hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain | Ascites |\n| >2% weight gain due to fluid retention | >5% weight gain from pre-HSCT baseline |\n\nIdiopathic pneumonia syndrome is a condition is characterized by widespread alveolar injury that occurs in the absence of active lower respiratory infection and cardiac causes. It encompasses a spectrum of pulmonary disorders as seen in Table [5](#Tab5), with an estimated incidence of 5–20% within the first 120 days after HSCT. Typical onset is around 3 weeks posttransplant with an estimated Day 100 mortality of 70–80%. Treatment is often empiric with broad-spectrum antimicrobials and high-dose corticosteroids. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is recommended to guide therapy. If the patient has adequate platelet count, transbronchial biopsy and/or open lung biopsy may be required for more accurate diagnosis [[37](#CR37), [81](#CR81)].\n\n#### Table 5.\n\nClinical spectrum idiopathic pneumonia syndrome [[81](#CR81)]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Chemoradiation toxicity |\n| Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) |\n| Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) |\n| Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) |\n| Restrictive lung disease |\n| Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) |\n| Interstitial pneumonitis |\n| Obstructive lung disease |\n| Bronchiolitis obliterans |\n| Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome |\n| Peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS) |\n| Capillary leak syndrome |\n\nAnother potential respiratory complication of transplant is the development of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). It is a rare condition but with a high mortality rate [[42](#CR42)]. Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of patchy bilateral ground glass or consolidative opacities on imaging [[39](#CR39)]. It is confirmed by bronchoscopy with samples that show progressively hemorrhagic returns on sequential lavages in the same subsegment of the lung. Samples may also show hemosiderin-laden macrophages on cytology [[20](#CR20)]. Treatment is mostly supportive care with broad-spectrum antibiotics for cases that are suspected to be secondary to infection and glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of underlying inflammation (i.e., capillaritis) or potential acute GVHD that is associated with some cases. The use of steroids in non-GVHD cases remains somewhat controversial since there is mixed data regarding their efficacy [[9](#CR9), [55](#CR55)]. There is also growing evidence for the potential use of recombinant factor VII as treatment for DAH [[10](#CR10), [29](#CR29), [50](#CR50), [53](#CR53)].\n\nHemorrhagic cystitis is a complication that can occur at two different time points in HSCT patients. During the pre-engraftment period, it most commonly associated with the preparative/conditioning regimen. Treatments given during the conditioning regimen associated with hemorrhagic cystitis include high-dose cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, and total body irradiation. However, hemorrhagic cystitis occurring in the post-engraftment period is primarily related to BK polyomavirus infection. This typically occurs within the first 100 days posttransplant and is most likely in alternative donor transplants (e.g., unrelated donors, haploidentical, cord blood transplants) [[21](#CR21), [66](#CR66)]. In haploidentical transplantation, the incidence of grade 2–4 hemorrhagic cystitis is approximately 25% [[54](#CR54)] and can be associated with obstruction and renal insufficiency [[33](#CR33), [38](#CR38), [48](#CR48)]. The use of alemtuzumab as part of the conditioning regimen has also been associated with increased risk for BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis [[49](#CR49)]. Reactivation of BK virus has also been associated with delayed immunologic reconstitution [[1](#CR1)]. Treatment includes predominantly drugs or cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes (CTLs). Cidofovir is the predominant pharmacologic agent used to treat BK virus infections with an estimated overall response rate of 79% that includes about 66% of complete responses [[12](#CR12)]. For those patients who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy or have contraindications to such therapy, the use of CTLs is a potential option [[6](#CR6), [78](#CR78)]. Occasionally patients will require percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for management of ureteral stenosis or obstruction.\n\n### Late Post-engraftment Complications\n\nThe late post-engraftment period is defined as anytime beyond Day +100. Disease progression remains the most common cause of mortality in the late post-engraftment period accounting for an estimated 47–58% of deaths over 100 days after allogeneic HSCT. However, patients may experience long-term quality of life and psychosocial issues including concerns over sexuality, fertility, financial toxicity, and integration back to society [[41](#CR41)]. Patients also remain at risk for infection with encapsulated organisms and varicella-zoster virus while awaiting complete immune reconstitution, which may take up to 2 years in allogeneic HSCT patients [[41](#CR41), [75](#CR75)]. Much like the early post-engraftment period, those patients requiring prolonged immunosuppression and corticosteroids during this time period remain at increased risk for a variety of viral and fungal infections requiring ongoing prophylaxis [[75](#CR75)].\n\nAnother late effect of HSCT is the risk for secondary cancers. While myeloid malignancies (i.e., secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia) are most common after autologous HSCT, there is a reported incidence of solid cancers in up to 15% of patients who are recipients of autologous or allogeneic HSCT. This incidence does not seem to have a plateau and is responsible for up to 5–10% of late deaths after HSCT. Risk factors include advanced age, the use of total body irradiation, and the development of chronic GVHD. Total body irradiation seems to have a strong association with the development of adenocarcinomas, whereas chronic GVHD seems to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Another unique malignancy that can be seen in EBV seropositive patients after allogeneic HSCT with T-cell-depleted grafts or intensive immunosuppression is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) [[19](#CR19)].\n\nLastly, the development of chronic GVHD is a major cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life in long-term survivors of HSCT. Chronic GVHD and its treatment is a severely immunosuppressive condition which could be associated with various infectious complications related to T-cell dysfunction, like fungal or viral infections, which occasionally may need ICU care. Unlike acute GVHD, chronic GVHD tends to have a gradual onset with symptoms starting after 6 months after transplant and may evolve to organ fibrosis with involvement primarily of the skin/fascia. Classic cases of chronic GVHD tend to occur after Day 100 of transplant, but some patients can develop symptoms earlier as a progressive evolution from acute GVHD. This is known as an overlap syndrome whereby patients exhibit signs and symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD. Approximately 70–80% of cases of chronic GVHD are preceded by acute GVHD with increased risk in patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells from unrelated donors. Treatment includes systemic therapy aimed at controlling the underlying destructive immunologic process (steroids, ruxolitinib, photopheresis) while also providing aggressive supportive care to address symptoms of pain, joint/fascia tightness, chronic dry mouth, and dry eyes. Patients also require ongoing surveillance for skin cancers. This is best accomplished in experienced transplant centers with a multidisciplinary team that includes a transplant physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist as available resources [[81](#CR81)].\n\n## End of Life Issues in HSCT Patients Admitted to the ICU\n\nStem cell transplant can be associated with complications that may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The estimated rate of ICU admission is 3.3% for autologous HSCT [[77](#CR77)] and approximately 16% (range of 9–30%) for allogeneic HSCT [[7](#CR7), [8](#CR8)]. The most commonly reported reasons for ICU admission are respiratory failure, sepsis, and infection. Although, ICU admission of a stem cell transplant patient, especially with an allogeneic graft, has been associated with a poor prognosis, overall, the survival of HSCT patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission has improved over the years. In fact, a single institution study of patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU showed no difference in survival between those patients who received a transplant and patients who did not receive a transplant [[23](#CR23)]. Furthermore, a single center retrospective study of 164 allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU showed a long-term survival rate of 61% and 51% at 1 year and 5 years, respectively. This was similar to patients who never required intensive care [[76](#CR76)]. van Vliet et al. [[79](#CR79)] also showed that admission to the ICU had no negative impact on long-term health-related quality of life for patients being treated for a hematologic malignancy. Forty-five percent (45%) of the patients in the study were recipients of HSCT. However, one of the ongoing struggles with HSCT patients in the ICU is the ability to predict prognosis and the optimal timing for end-of-life discussions with the patients and caregivers.\n\nCommunication between the ICU and transplant teams is a key factor in avoiding conflict over the timing of admission to the ICU and goals of care. This seems to be particularly an issue for those patients who undergo allogeneic HSCT with curative intent where studies of traditional organ function indexes (i.e., APACHE II, APACHE III, and SOFA) seem to provide conflicting results for the ability to predict ICU outcomes in the HSCT population. Afessa et al. [[2](#CR2)] found the APACHE III score to have a moderate discrimination and good calibration in predicting hospital mortality, while the APACHE II score had no prognostic value. Gilli et al. [[26](#CR26)] concluded that the APACHE II score underestimated mortality, while the use of the SOFA score correlated with hospital mortality. Specifically, there were no patients with a SOFA score >11 who survived in this study. Two other studies also showed a correlation of higher SOFA score with increased hospital mortality [[47](#CR47), [77](#CR77)]. Other studies also suggest that the need for mechanical ventilation is associated with shorter survival [[2](#CR2), [52](#CR52), [68](#CR68)]. Furthermore, the combination of liver failure and renal failure in mechanically ventilated HSCT patients seems to be universally fatal [[4](#CR4), [25](#CR25), [60](#CR60)].\n\nIn addition to communication among providers, it is also imperative that the transplant team has addressed advance care planning (ACP) with the patient prior to HSCT. Ganti et al. [[24](#CR24)] showed in a study of 343 patients undergoing HSCT (including both allogeneic and autologous) that ACP was associated with a decrease risk for post-HSCT mortality with an estimated 1-year probability of survival of 77% without ACP and 89% with ACP (HR for risk of death 2.11; 95% CI, 1.34–3.33; *p* = 0.001). This group concluded that the patients least likely to have planned for poor outcomes are the most likely to face them and engaging in ACP is not inconsistent with hoping for the best outcome in HSCT [[24](#CR24), [40](#CR40)].\n\nIn conclusion, the ICU care for the hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients is complex due to the severely immunosuppressed state of these patients in the early posttransplant period. Complications are primarily related to infections or organ failure from chemotherapy. Even though concerns remain with the need for ICU care in allogeneic hematopoietic transplant recipients, several studies have shown encouraging results, likely related to an overall lower intensity of conditioning regimens, better prevention of infectious complications, expanded availability of treatment options, and better recognition of potential complications that can occur in these patients.\n\n## Contributor Information\n\nJoseph L.

There are several types of HPSCT in clinical use, and transplanted cells may be obtained from several sources. This procedure has several benefits and may be used to treat malignant and non-malignant conditions. It helps to augment bone marrow function. In addition, depending on the disease being treated, it may allow for the destruction of malignant tumor cells. It can also generate functional cells that replace dysfunctional ones in cases like immune deficiency syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and other diseases. Survival rates after HPSCT are increasing, but morbidity due to complications of the procedure continues. This activity reviews the indications for HPSCT, the different options by which to obtain donor cells, including the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the acute and chronic complications of the procedure. Additionally, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo HPSCT to improve patient outcomes and decrease procedure-associated morbidities.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n* Describe the malignant and non-malignant indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplants.\n* Contrast the advantages and disadvantages of different types of hematopoietic stem cells.\n* Outline the potential complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplants and apply strategies to ameliorate these risks.\n* Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants.\n\n[Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.](https://www.statpearls.com/account/trialuserreg/?articleid=22708&utm_source=pubmed&utm_campaign=reviews&utm_content=22708)\n\n## Introduction\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HPSCT), sometimes referred to as bone marrow transplant, involves administering healthy hematopoietic stem cells to patients with dysfunctional or depleted bone marrow. This procedure has several benefits. It helps to augment bone marrow function. In addition, depending on the disease being treated, it may allow for the destruction of malignant tumor cells. It can also generate functional cells that replace dysfunctional ones in cases like immune deficiency syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and other diseases.\n\n**History and Evolution**\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HPSCT) was first explored for use in humans in the 1950s. It was based on observational studies in mice models, which showed that infusion of healthy bone marrow components into a myelosuppressed bone marrow could induce recovery of its function in the recipient.[[1]](#article-22708.r1) These animal-based studies soon found their clinical application in humans when the first successful bone marrow transplant was performed between monozygotic twins in New York in 1957 to treat acute leukemia.[[2]](#article-22708.r2) The performing physician, E. Donnell Thomas, continued his research on the development of bone marrow transplantation and later received the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine for his work. The first successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant was reported in Minnesota in 1968 for a pediatric patient with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome.[[3]](#article-22708.r3)\n\nSince then, allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplants have increased in the United States (US) and worldwide. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) reported over 8000 allogeneic transplants performed in the US in 2016, with an even greater number of autologous transplants; autologous transplants have steadily outpaced allogeneic transplants over time.[[4]](#article-22708.r4)[[5]](#article-22708.r5)\n\n**Definitions**\n\n**Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)**\n\nThe human MHC genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p) encode for human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and are highly polymorphic. These polymorphisms lead to significant differences in the resultant expressed human cell-surface proteins. They are divided into MHC class I and MHC class II.\n\n**Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA)**\n\nThe HLA proteins are expressed on the cellular surface and play an essential role in alloimmunity. HLA class I molecules, encoded by MHC class I, can be divided into HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. These proteins are expressed on all cell types and present peptides derived from the cytoplasm and recognized by CD8+ T cells. HLA class II molecules are classified as HLA- DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR, are encoded by MHC class II, can be found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and are recognized by CD4+ T cells.\n\n**Syngeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\nThe donor and the recipient are identical twins. The advantages of this type of transplant include no risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) or graft failure. Unfortunately, however, only a very few transplant patients will have an identical twin available for transplantation.\n\n**Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation**\n\nThe bone marrow products are collected from the patient and are reinfused after purification methods. The advantage of this type of transplant is no risk of GVHD. The disadvantage is that the reinfused bone marrow products may contain abnormal cells that can cause relapse in the case of malignancy; hence, theoretically, this method cannot be used in all cases of abnormal bone marrow diseases.\n\n**Allogeneic Transplantation**\n\nThe donor is an HLA-matched family member, an unrelated HLA-matched donor, or a mismatched family donor (haploidentical).\n\n**Engraftment**\n\nThe process by which infused transplanted hematopoietic stem cells produce mature progeny in the peripheral circulation.\n\n**Preparative Regimen**\n\nThis regimen comprises high-dose chemotherapy or total body irradiation (TBI) or both, which are administered to the recipient before stem cell infusion to eliminate the largest number of malignant cells and induce immunosuppression in the recipient so that engraftment can occur.\n\n## Indications\n\n**Malignant Disease**\n\n**Multiple Myeloma**\n\nStudies have shown increased overall survival and progression-free survival in patients younger than 65 years when consolidation therapy with melphalan is initiated, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide maintenance therapy.[[6]](#article-22708.r6) The study showed a favorable outcome of high-dose melphalan plus HPSCT compared to consolidation therapy with melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide. It also showed better outcomes in patients who received maintenance therapy with lenalidomide.\n\n**Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**\n\nStudies have shown that in cases of recurrent Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that do not respond to initial conventional chemotherapy, chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation leads to better outcomes. A randomized controlled trial by Schmitz showed a better outcome at three years of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant compared to aggressive conventional chemotherapy in relapsed chemosensitive Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups.[[7]](#article-22708.r7) CIBMTR reports that his group of malignancies accounts for the second highest number of HPSCTs in the US, after multiple myeloma.\n\n**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplant has been shown to improve outcomes. It may prolong overall survival in patients with AML who fail primary induction therapy and do not achieve a complete response.[[8]](#article-22708.r8) The study recommended that early HLA typing for patients with AML is beneficial if they fail induction therapy and are considered for HPSCT.\n\n**Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)**\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplant is indicated in refractory and resistant cases of ALL when induction therapy fails for a second time to induce remission. Some studies suggest an increased benefit of allogeneic HPSCT in patients with high-risk ALL, including patients with the Philadelphia chromosome and those with t(4;11).[[9]](#article-22708.r9)\n\n**Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)**\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplant is considered curative in cases of disease progression and is only indicated in intermediate- or high-risk patients with MDS.\n\n**Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**\n\nPatients with CML and CLL received the fewest number of allogeneic transplants in 2020. HPSCT has high cure rates for CML, but because tyrosine kinase inhibitors pair high success rates with a low adverse risk profile, HPSCT is reserved for patients with refractory disease.\n\n**Myelofibrosis, Essential Thrombocytosis, and Polycythemia Vera**\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplant has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with myelofibrosis and those diagnosed with myelofibrosis preceded by essential thrombocytosis or polycythemia vera.[[10]](#article-22708.r10)\n\n**Solid Tumors**\n\nAutologous stem cell transplant is considered the standard of care in patients with testicular germ cell tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy; in this case, refractory is defined as the third recurrence with chemotherapy.[[11]](#article-22708.r11) HPSCT has also been studied in medulloblastoma, metastatic breast cancer, and other solid tumors.\n\n**Non-Malignant Diseases**\n\n**Aplastic Anemia**\n\nSystematic and retrospective studies have suggested an improved outcome with HPSCT in acquired aplastic anemia compared to conventional immunosuppressive therapy.[[12]](#article-22708.r12) In a study of 1886 patients with acquired aplastic anemia, transplanted cells collected from the bone marrow produced superior outcomes compared to those collected from the peripheral blood.[[13]](#article-22708.r13) Patients with aplastic anemia need a preparative regimen, as they still can develop immune rejection to the graft.\n\n**Severe Combined Immune Deficiency Syndrome (SCID)**\n\nLarge retrospective studies have shown increased overall survival in infants with SCID when they received the transplant early after birth before the onset of infections.[[14]](#article-22708.r14)\n\n**Thalassemia**\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplant from a matched sibling donor is an option to treat certain types of thalassemia and has shown 15-year survival rates reaching near 80%. However, recent retrospective data showed similar overall survival compared to conventional treatments with multiple blood transfusions.[[15]](#article-22708.r15)\n\n**Sickle Cell Disease**\n\nAn allogeneic stem cell transplant is recommended to treat sickle cell disease.[[16]](#article-22708.r16)\n\n**Other Non-malignant Diseases**\n\nHPSCT has been used to treat chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Kostman syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Blackfan-Diamond anemia, and enzymatic disorders. Moreover, the role of HPSCT is expanding in non-malignant autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and has already shown promising results in cases like neuromyelitis optica.[[17]](#article-22708.r17)[[18]](#article-22708.r18)[[19]](#article-22708.r19)[[20]](#article-22708.r20)[[21]](#article-22708.r21)[[22]](#article-22708.r22)[[23]](#article-22708.r23)[[24]](#article-22708.r24)[[25]](#article-22708.r25) It is also considered best practice for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.[[26]](#article-22708.r26)[[27]](#article-22708.r27)\n\n## Contraindications\n\nThere are no absolute contraindications for hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\n## Equipment\n\nSpecial equipment exists for collecting, preserving, and administering stem cell products.\n\n## Personnel\n\nAn interprofessional team approach is a mainstay of ensuring the high-quality collection and infusion of stem cell products.\n\n## Preparation\n\nPreparation includes:\n\n## Technique or Treatment\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\nThe mechanism of action of HPSCT in leukemia is based on the effect of the graft and donor immunity against malignant cells in recipients. These findings were demonstrated in a study that involved over 2000 patients with different leukemias treated with HPSCT. The study showed the lowest relapse rates were in patients who received non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells and those who developed GVHD compared to patients who received T-cell-depleted stem cells, those who did not develop GVHD, and patients who received syngeneic grafts. These findings support the notion that donor cellular immunity is central to engraftment efficacy against tumor cells.[[28]](#article-22708.r28)\n\nThe mechanism of action of HPSCT in autoimmune diseases is believed to be secondary to the increase in T-cell regulatory function, which promotes immune tolerance. However, more studies are needed to determine the exact physiology.\n\nIn hemoglobinopathies, the transplanted stem cells produce functional cells after engraftment that replace the diseased cells.\n\n**Administration**\n\n**HLA Typing**\n\nHLA typing is essential to determine the most suitable donor for stem cell collection. In theory, matched, related donors are the best candidates, followed by matched unrelated donors, cord blood, and haploidentical donors. HLA typing is analyzed at either an intermediate-resolution level, which entails detecting a small number of matched alleles between the donor serum and the recipient, or at a high-resolution level to determine the specific number of polymorphic alleles at a higher level. Polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing are used for HLA typing, and the results are reported as a score correlating with a match of two alleles for a specific HLA type. Different institutions use a different number of HLA subtypes for the eligibility of donors. However, studies that showed high-resolution matching for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 were associated with improved survival and outcomes.[[29]](#article-22708.r29) The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BM CTN) has proposed donor HLA assessment and matching recommendations.[[30]](#article-22708.r30)\n\nThe process may vary depending on the source of the stem cell site collection, whether it is bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood. Moreover, there is a slight difference based on whether it is autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic HPSCT. For example, the procedure consists of the initial mobilization of stem cells, in which peripheral blood stem cells are collected, given the low number and the need for high levels of progeny cells. This is then followed by a preparative regimen and, finally, infusion.\n\n**Mobilization and Collection**\n\nMobilization and collection procedures involve using medication to increase the number of stem cells in the peripheral blood, given that there are insufficient stem cells in the peripheral blood. Medications include granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) or chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) blockers like plerixafor. G-CSF is believed to enhance neutrophils to release serine proteases, which break vascular adhesion molecules and promote the release of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow. Plerixafor blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1) to CXCR, leading to stem cell mobilization to the peripheral blood.[[31]](#article-22708.r31) CD34+ is considered the marker for progenitor hematopoietic stem cells in the peripheral blood, and usually, a dose of 2 to 10 x 10/kg CD34+ cells/kg is needed for proper engraftment. Chemotherapy can sometimes be used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells; this process is termed chemoembolization.\n\nThe usual site of bone marrow collection is the anterior or posterior iliac crest. The aspiration procedure can be performed under local or general anesthesia. Common complications include pain and fever; serious iatrogenic complications occur in less than 1% of cases. Each aspiration contains 15 mL, and multiple aspirations are done. The goal is to collect 1 to 1.5 L of bone marrow product from the aspirations. The dose of nucleated cells from bone marrow should range between 2 to 4 x 10 cells/kg; overall survival and long-term engraftment are strongly influenced by cell dose in allogeneic HPSCT.[[32]](#article-22708.r32)\n\n**Preparative Regimen**\n\nThe preparative regimen consists of the administration of chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation for the eradication of malignant cells and induction of immune tolerance for the transfused cells to engraft properly. This process is not limited to patients with malignancies. It extends to cases like aplastic anemia and hemoglobinopathies, given that these patients have intact immune systems that could cause graft failure if there is no conditioning.\n\nThe administration of the preparative regimen should immediately precede the HPSCT. As a general rule, the effect of the regimen should produce bone marrow suppression within 1 to 3 weeks of administration. The preparative regimen is divided into myeloablative conditioning and reduced-intensity conditioning. Different combination regimens are used in the preparative period, depending on the disease being treated, existing comorbidities, previous radiation exposure, and the source of the harvested hematopoietic stem cells.\n\nReduced-intensity conditioning is preferred in patients who are older, have had prior radiotherapy, have comorbidities, and have a history of extensive chemotherapy before HPSCT.[[33]](#article-22708.r33) The advantages of using reduced-intensity conditioning include less need for transfusion due to transient post-transplant pancytopenia, less chemotherapy-induced liver damage, and less radiation-induced lung damage.[[34]](#article-22708.r34) However, the relapse rates after reduced-intensity conditioning are higher. Nevertheless, these regimens are better tolerated and have a better safety profile in specific patient populations.\n\nMost chemotherapies used in preparative regimens consist of potent immunosuppressive agents like high doses of cyclophosphamide, alkylating agents like busulfan, nucleoside analogs like fludarabine, and many other agents like melphalan, anti-thymocyte globulin, rituximab, and gemcitabine. Total body irradiation is performed using fractionated doses; there is less pulmonary toxicity than with a one-dose regimen.[[35]](#article-22708.r35)\n\nReinfusion of either fresh or cryopreserved stem cells can occur in an ambulatory setting and takes up to two hours. Before the infusion begins, quality measures are performed to ensure the number of CD34+ cells is sufficient.\n\nIn the particular case of SCID, there is no need for a preparative regimen in patients receiving cells from HLA-matched siblings. This is because no abnormal cells need to be eliminated, and the immunosuppression caused by SCID can prevent graft rejection.\n\n**Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Hematopoietic Stem Cells**\n\nOne advantage of peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) is a more rapid engraftment rate than the bone marrow-derived stem cells; recovery in the former is two weeks and is delayed for five days more in the latter. Using a post-transplant immunosuppressive regimen to prevent GVHD can prolong the increase in bone marrow products.[[36]](#article-22708.r36) Moreover, the rate of acute GVHD between PBSCT and bone marrow transplantation appears to be similar in HLA-identical matched related donors.[[36]](#article-22708.r36) However, chronic GVHD is a more common occurrence after PBSCT, which could lead to more complications. Two-year overall survival rates seem to be similar regardless of stem cell origin.[[37]](#article-22708.r37) Other studies comparing bone marrow-derived transplant and PSCT concluded that the psychological burden due to chronic GVHD and the 5-year ability to restore normal activities, including returning to work, was better in the bone marrow-derived transplant group.[[38]](#article-22708.r38)\n\nThe advantages of cord blood transplant include the rapid collection and administration times, which facilitate treating urgent conditions, less frequent infections, lower rates of GVHD with the same rate of GVT, and less need for a stringent identical HLA. The disadvantages include delayed engraftment, a higher possibility of graft rejection, and higher rates of disease relapses. The cord blood transplant is most commonly used in patients without matched-related or unrelated donors. One major study demonstrated the utility of cord blood transplants in patients with thalassemia-major and sickle cell disease, indicating similar 6-year overall survival rates compared to the bone marrow-derived transplants.[[39]](#article-22708.r39)\n\nThe most important factors affecting the success of cord blood transplant are the total nucleated cell dose and HLA matching; the recommended minimum dose of total nucleated cells for successful engraftment is 2 x 10^7 cells/kg. Theoretically, strict HLA matching is not required in the case of cord blood transplant as cord blood is devoid of mature T cells, but studies have shown better outcomes when matching recipients at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1.[[40]](#article-22708.r40) Given that a single cord blood unit might not contain the required amount of nucleated cells, a double cord transplant is used. However, only one cord blood transplant product will dominate within three months of infusion. Further, randomized controlled trials failed to show a significant difference in outcome, benefits, or risks between double cord blood and a single cord blood transplant.[[41]](#article-22708.r41)[[42]](#article-22708.r42)\n\nHaploidentical stem cell transplantation involves administering bone marrow products from a first-degree related haplotype-mismatched donor.[[43]](#article-22708.r43) This helps underserved patients without broad access to resources as they have fewer chances of having a matched unrelated donor.[[44]](#article-22708.r44) The advantages of this method include lower cost and rapid availability of hematopoietic cell products. However, the disadvantages include hyperacute GVHD, which increases mortality and graft rejection.[[45]](#article-22708.r45) This has been overcome by the depletion of T cells responsible for the reaction mentioned above, but this also leads to delayed immune recovery and decreased graft versus tumor effect. Recently strategies including selective depletion of subsets of T cells, including alpha-beta, have shown improved outcomes compared to conventional ex vivo depletion of large T-cell populations.[[46]](#article-22708.r46)\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications after bone marrow transplant may be acute or chronic. Many factors can affect these adverse events, including age, baseline performance status, the source of stem cell transplant, and the type and intensity of the preparative regimen. Acute complications occur in the first 90 days, including myelosuppression with neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia; sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; mucositis; acute graft versus host disease; bacterial infections with gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; *Herpesviridae* infections; and fungal infection with *Candida* and *Aspergillus*. Chronic complications include chronic GVHD, infection with encapsulated bacteria, and reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus.\n\n**Antimicrobial Prophylaxis**\n\nLevofloxacin is usually given orally or intravenously and initiated on the first day post-transplant. It is continued until the absolute neutrophil count is more than 1000 cells/microL or until the discontinuation of prednisone in cases of GVHD.[[47]](#article-22708.r47)\n\nProphylaxis against *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (PCP) is warranted, given the immunosuppression following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[[48]](#article-22708.r48) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is usually used, and several dosing regimens have been proposed. TMP-SMX may be given twice weekly until the patient is off immunosuppression.[[49]](#article-22708.r49) Antifungal infection prophylaxis with fluconazole is recommended for one month following the transplant as it has been shown to decrease the incidence of fungal infections. No difference was seen when fluconazole was compared to voriconazole.[[50]](#article-22708.r50)[[51]](#article-22708.r51) However, voriconazole is used in patients with an elevated risk of developing severe antifungal infections. Anti-viral prophylaxis is achieved with acyclovir, continued for one month to prevent herpes-simplex virus and one year to prevent varicella-zoster virus.[[52]](#article-22708.r52) Prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus is only recommended in patients who test positive by PCR, and the treatment of choice is ganciclovir.\n\nOne unique syndrome encountered with cord stem cell transplant is cord colitis which involves diarrhea in recipients of cord blood and is believed to be secondary to *Bradyrhizobium enterica*, which usually responds to a course of metronidazole or levofloxacin.[[53]](#article-22708.r53)\n\n**Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS)**\n\nSinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), or veno-occlusive disease (VOD), results from chemotherapy during a preparative regimen and occurs within six weeks of HPSCT. This syndrome consists of tender hepatomegaly, jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, and weight gain due to fluid retention. The incidence is reported to be 13.6% in an analysis study assessing the existing literature on the incidence of the disease.[[54]](#article-22708.r54) The pathophysiology consists of endothelial damage to the hepatic sinusoids leading to obstruction and necrosis of the centrilobular liver.[[55]](#article-22708.r55) The destruction of the sinusoids leads to hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, which are responsible for the related mortality. The agents most commonly implicated in causing this syndrome are oral busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Using intravenous busulfan has been shown to decrease the occurrence of SOS.[[56]](#article-22708.r56)\n\nThe diagnosis of SOS is clinical and is based on hyperbilirubinemia greater than 2 mg/dL in the presence of the aforementioned clinical findings. Treatment consists of ursodeoxycholic acid, which has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of SOS when given pre- and post-transplant.[[57]](#article-22708.r57) Another medication, defibrotide, has shown efficacy in treating SOS when it occurs.[[58]](#article-22708.r58)[[59]](#article-22708.r59)\n\n**Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS)**\n\nIdiopathic pneumonia syndrome usually occurs in the first 90 days post-transplant. The incidence is low and is related to the direct chemotoxicity of the preparative regimen. Treatment with steroids is standard, although no randomized controlled clinical trials have been done to support their efficacy. Recently, etanercept has been studied; adding soluble TNF-inhibitors to steroids has not shown added efficacy.[[60]](#article-22708.r60)\n\n**Graft Rejection or Failure**\n\nA loss of bone marrow function after reconstitution following infusion of hematopoietic stem cells or no gain of function after infusion is termed graft rejection or failure. The incidence of failure is highest when there is a high HLA disparity; this disparity is highest in cases of cord blood and haploidentical donors and lowest with autologous and matched donor siblings. Factors responsible for graft failure include but are not limited to functional residual host immune response to the donor cells, a low number of infused cells, in vitro damage during collection and cryopreservation, inadequate preparative regimen, and infections.\n\nChimerism refers to the presence of a cell population from a person in the blood of a different person. Evaluating for chimerism is an important step in ensuring engraftment and success of the transplantation. This evaluation is done by checking the expression of CD33, which indicates the presence of granulocytes, and CD3, which indicates the presence of T cells, and confirming that most of the cells present are from the donor. The importance of effective chimerism has been demonstrated in many studies that showed decreased relapse rates and increased survival in allogeneic transplantation.[[61]](#article-22708.r61)\n\n**Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)**\n\nGraft versus host disease (GVHD) is a reaction between T cells from the donor in an allogeneic transplant and the recipient's HLA polymorphic epitopes, leading to a constellation of symptoms and manifestations. GVHD may be acute or chronic; each is sub-categorized into classic and late-onset, classic, and chronic overlap.[[62]](#article-22708.r62)\n\nAcute GVHD usually develops within three months. However, it can develop after three months and is then termed delayed acute GVHD. Prophylaxis is generally achieved with calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, and anti-thymocyte globulins. The severity of GVHD is estimated using the Glucksberg scale, which classifies acute GVHD from grade I to VI. Treatment with either high-dose prednisone or methylprednisolone is indicated in higher-grade disease.[[63]](#article-22708.r63)\n\nChronic GVHD occurs over three months after transplant and involves multiple organs, similar to collagen vascular diseases. Grading of chronic GVHD assesses the severity of the disease and has been developed by the National Institute of Health; grade determines the treatment modality and predicts survival [[64]](#article-22708.r64). Treatment is similar to acute GVHD, but the duration of treatment is usually more than two years.[[65]](#article-22708.r65)\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nChemotherapy and radiation of the preparative regimen and post-transplant immunosuppression can induce severe pancytopenia in the first week following infusion of hematopoietic stem cells, leading to life-threatening infection. This depends on the type and the dose of chemotherapy administered and factors related to the recipients. Chemotherapy causes the destruction of healthy, normal bone marrow products, including neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Also, chemotherapy-induced mucosal toxicity disrupts the barriers protecting against infectious agents, and the use of indwelling intravenous catheters provides another means for the entrance of infectious agents.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, vaccination against the following agents is recommended: pneumococcus, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, *Haemophilus influenzae*, meningococcus, polio, Hepatitis B virus, influenza, measles, mumps, and rubella.[[47]](#article-22708.r47) Several prophylaxis regimens have been proposed to prevent infections depending on the risk stratification of patients.\n\nMany risk-scoring tools exist for evaluating hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to stratify risk so that proper preparation and treatment can be established to minimize the risks and toxicities before, during, and after transplantation. The most commonly utilized scoring tools in clinical practice are the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score, the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index/age, and the Armand disease risk index.[[66]](#article-22708.r66)[[67]](#article-22708.r67)[[68]](#article-22708.r68)\n\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n\nThe use of HPSCT in clinical practice has expanded in the last decade, and there are many ongoing clinical trials to assess its efficacy in different medical conditions. However, given the lack of knowledge across most medical practices, an interprofessional team approach to care can help improve patient outcomes, where all team members can offer suggestions and guidance based on their knowledge and experience regarding potential stem cell transplant therapy for patients where it can benefit.\n\n## Review Questions\n\n## References\n\n**Disclosure:** Karam Khaddour declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\n\n**Disclosure:** Caroline Hana declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\n\n**Disclosure:** Prerna Mewawalla declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\n\nThis book is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)), which permits others to distribute the work, provided that the article is not altered or used commercially.

About 14 disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are currently approved for the treatment of MS. However, despite the use of highly effective therapies, some patients exhibit a highly active disease with an aggressive course from onset and a higher risk of long-term disability accrual. In the last few years, several retrospective studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have investigated autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) as a possible therapeutic option in order to address this unmet clinical need. These studies demonstrated that AHSCT is a highly efficacious and relatively safe therapeutic option for the treatment of highly active MS. Particularly, over recent years, the amount of evidence has grown, with significant improvements in the development of patient selection criteria, choice of the most suitable transplant technique and clinical experience. In this paper, we present six patients who received AHSCT in our MS center and we systematically reviewed recent evidence about the long-term efficacy and safety of AHSCT and the placement of AHSCT in the rapidly evolving therapeutic armamentarium for MS.\n\n**Keywords:** multiple sclerosis, treatment, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative and immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammatory demyelination and subsequently gliosis and axonal loss [[1](#B1-jcm-11-00942),[2](#B2-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nOver the last two decades, thanks to the growing knowledge about MS pathogenesis, a fair amount of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been developed for the treatment of MS. These drugs have different mechanisms of action directed to control the inflammatory component of the disease, with the result of reducing the risk of relapse and the accumulation of the disability [[2](#B2-jcm-11-00942)]. To date, a total of 14 DMTs have been approved with different efficacies and safety profiles. Despite their use, many patients remain at some risk for relapses and disability progression; in particular, those exhibiting a severe disease activity despite the use of highly active treatment or showing an aggressive course from disease onset are exposed to a high risk of long-term disability accrual [[3](#B3-jcm-11-00942)]. In these cases, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) can be considered as a possible therapeutic option. AHSCT has been employed to treat MS over the last two decades and, unlike most of the currently approved DMTs, it was originally applied in hematologic settings and, since the 1990s, has been used to treat refractory autoimmune diseases [[4](#B4-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe aim of AHSCT is to remove the aberrant immune system and then to reconstitute the immune system in order to prevent recurrent neuroinflammatory activity [[5](#B5-jcm-11-00942),[6](#B6-jcm-11-00942)]. In contrast with currently approved DMTs, AHSCT is an intensive one-off treatment, following which, most of the patients will have no need for additional therapies. Indeed, AHSCT provides a rapid resolution of disease activity, either in terms of relapse or disability progression, while, in the long term, the reset immune tolerance due to the reconstitution of a new immune system is associated with sustained clinical responses.\n\nIn the past, concerns regarding the mortality rate of AHSCT have previously limited its use for the treatment of MS, as MS is usually a non-life-threatening disease. However, thanks to the increasing transplant center experience and careful patient selection over the few last years, AHSCT has become relatively safe with minimal risk of treatment-related mortality. For all these reasons, in October 2020, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society proposed AHSCT as a suitable treatment option for relapsing MS patients who exhibit higher disease activity in terms of a high relapse rate and/or new/enlarged MRI lesions, despite treatment with second-line DMTs or have contraindications to highly effective DMTs [[7](#B7-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn the present paper, we present six cases of MS who received AHSCT in our MS center and we reviewed the main findings about the efficacy and safety of AHSCT for the treatment of MS patients and the new placement of AHSCT in the rapidly evolving therapeutic scenario of MS.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Case Series Presentation\n\nIn this study, we collected data about 6 patients who had received AHSCT for MS in our MS center in the period between 2019 and 2021. All patients received AHSCT in the Hematology Department at the Hospital “G. Rodolico—San Marco”, University of Catania (Catania, Italy).\n\n### 2.2. Literature Search\n\nWe systematically searched all the published studies reporting AHSCT for MS on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and Clinical Trials. The literature review was carried out using keywords and MeSH terms for the concepts “multiple sclerosis” and “autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation”. We included all the peer-reviewed, full-text and English language articles published between 2001 and 2021. In particular, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), longitudinal studies, non-randomized clinical trials, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, reviews and studies from national and international registries were selected. We excluded single case studies, pediatric studies and non-peer-reviewed papers. If publications were not available via open or institutional access, the authors of the papers were contacted. The PRISMA flow diagram is illustrated in [Figure 1](#jcm-11-00942-f001).\n\n#### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc1c/8875789/c7b0f87819ed/jcm-11-00942-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8875789_jcm-11-00942-g001.jpg)\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc1c/8875789/c7b0f87819ed/jcm-11-00942-g001.jpg)\n\nPRISMA flow. AHSCT, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n## 3. Case Series\n\nSix patients, including three (50%) females, with a mean age of 35.8 ± 10.9 years, received AHSCT for MS in our MS center ([Table 1](#jcm-11-00942-t001)). Three of them were affected by highly active RMS disease and the remaining had SPMS. The mean follow-up was 16.6 ± 9.8 months. All patients underwent a BEAM+ATG conditioning regimen. After the procedure, our cohort showed that the relapse rate was considerably reduced in all patients, with no relapses occurring after AHSCT. In our cohort, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) improved in three out of six patients after AHSCT, stabilized in two and worse in only one after one year, confirming the high efficacy of AHSCT in terms of EDSS stabilization. In contrast, the only patient who reported disease progression had a higher level of disability at the time of the transplant procedure.\n\n### Table 1.\n\nDemographical and clinical characteristics of the patients who received AHSCT.\n\n| Patient | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years) | 29 | 28 | 29 | 31 | 55 | 43 |\n| Sex | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female |\n| Disease duration (months) | 138 | 123 | 171 | 132 | 72 | 84 |\n| MS phenotype | RMS | RMS | RMS | SP | SP | RMS |\n| Prior therapies | Natalizumab, rituximab | Natalizumab | IFN-beta1a s.c., teriflunomide, fingolimod, rituximab | Cyclophosphamide, IFN-beta1a s.c., natalizumab | IFN-beta1a s.c., fingolimod, alemtuzumab (two courses) | Alemtuzumab (three courses) |\n| N of relapses at MS diagnosis | 4 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 3 | 2 |\n| N of relapses in the year before AHSCT | 2 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 |\n| N of relapses after AHSCT | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| EDSS at onset | 4.5 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 4.5 | 6.5 | 4.0 |\n| EDSS before AHSCT | 6.0 | 3.0 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.0 | 5.0 |\n| EDSS 6 months after AHSCT | 6.0 | 2.5 | 4.0 | 6.5 | 7.0 | 4.0 |\n| EDSS 12 months after AHSCT | 6.0 | 2.0 | 4.0 | NA | 7.5 | NA |\n| N of new/enlarged/Gd-enhanced lesions at MS diagnosis | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 |\n| N of new/enlarged/Gd-enhanced lesions before AHSCT | 2 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| N of new/enlarged/Gd+-enhanced lesions 6 months after AHSCT | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| N of new/enlarged/Gd+-enhanced lesions 12 months after AHSCT | 0 | 0 | 0 | NA | 0 | NA |\n| Date of AHSCT | 11/Jan/2021 | 01/Jul/2019 | 22/Dec/2020 | 30/March/2021 | 22/Jan/2020 | 01/September/2021 |\n| Conditioning regimen | BEAM | BEAM | BEAM | BEAM | BEAM | BEAM |\n| AEs (grade) during and/or after AHSCT | None | None | Fever (mild) | Urinary infection (moderate) | Fever (mild) | None |\n| Previous COVID-19 infection | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Date of COVID-19 vaccination (both doses) \\* | May/June 2021 | March 2021 | April 2021 | June 2021 | March/May 2021 | March/April 2021 |\n| COVID-19 third dose of vaccine \\* | November 2021 | November 2021 | December 2021 | Not done yet | November 2021 | Not done yet |\n| Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies titre (date) | 163 BAU/mL (October 2021) | 43 BAU/mL (September 2021) | 54.2 BAU/mL (October 2021) | 219.7 BAU/mL (October 2021) | 164.9 BAU/mL (October 2021) | 287.3 BAU/mL (September 2021) |\n| Comorbidities | Thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis | None | None | None | Hypertension, spasticity | None |\n\nAHSCT: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; BAU/mL: binding antibody unit/mL; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; IFN: interferon; s.c.: subcutaneously administered; i.m.: intramuscularly administered; EDSS: Expanded Disability Status Scale; Gd: gadolinium; MS: multiple sclerosis, SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. \\* All patients were vaccinated with BioNTech (Comirnaty), Pfizer®.\n\nThe risk profile of AHSCT was acceptable and the grade of AEs (in three patients) was mild. No severe AEs were reported. So far, no long-term toxicity has been reported.\n\nMoreover, all patients were vaccinated with both doses of the Comirnaty vaccine (BioNTech, Pfizer®, Mainz, Germany) and four of them underwent the booster dose. A measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies performed after the vaccination showed a slightly lower response compared to the general population.\n\n## 4. Biological Background and Rationale\n\nThe rationale for using AHSCT as a treatment option for MS is the removal of the self-reactive immune system through immunoablative agents, resulting in the depletion of autoreactive effector cells and the reconstitution of an immune system with more normal functions thanks to the infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells [[8](#B8-jcm-11-00942),[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. After AHSCT, the analysis of circulating lymphocytes shows the decrease in the circulating autoreactive effector T cells, mostly Th17, together with the development of recent thymic emigrants post transplant [[4](#B4-jcm-11-00942),[10](#B10-jcm-11-00942),[11](#B11-jcm-11-00942)]. The grade of the variability of the reconstituted T cell depends on the intensity of the conditioning regimen [[12](#B12-jcm-11-00942)]. According to a recent study, prior to the transplant procedure, it was demonstrated that the presence of circulating mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs) with CD8+, a CD161 high phenotype [[13](#B13-jcm-11-00942)], may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, promoting the production of several cytokines, such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-17a, and thus, exerting a pro-inflammatory effect [[14](#B14-jcm-11-00942)]. After transplantation, these cells showed a significant reduction in the peripheral blood, together with an increment in regulatory CD4+, FoxP3+ T cells, CD127 and CD25 high [[15](#B15-jcm-11-00942)]. The reconstitution of this “new” immune system may be responsible for the high efficacy of AHSCT, which is sustained even in the case of the re-occurrence of autoreactive effector cells [[10](#B10-jcm-11-00942)]. In addition, other mechanisms were proposed, including changes in the genes expression, in particular, the downregulation of microRNAs associated with MS pathogenesis [[11](#B11-jcm-11-00942),[16](#B16-jcm-11-00942)]. Thus, the complex mechanisms responsible for the long-term benefit of AHSCT are not fully understood.\n\n## 5. Procedure\n\nAHSCT consists of four main steps: mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC), HSPs collection, conditioning and reinfusion of HSPs and blood/immune therapy [[17](#B17-jcm-11-00942)]. The procedure should be performed in a hematological ward with accredited stem cell laboratory facilities associated with stem cell transplant programs ([Figure 2](#jcm-11-00942-f002)).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc1c/8875789/b4af699c96ff/jcm-11-00942-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8875789_jcm-11-00942-g002.jpg)\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc1c/8875789/b4af699c96ff/jcm-11-00942-g002.jpg)\n\nAHSCT procedure.\n\nAfter neurological and hematological consultations aimed at verifying the inclusion criteria and discussing the benefits and the risks of the autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) procedure, the MS patient is admitted to a hematological ward (screening). This first step includes mobilization consisting of the administration of chemotherapy, mainly cyclophosphamide (Cy) with a dosage of 2–4 g/m2, followed by daily granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with the dosage of 5–10 μg/kg daily until harvest completion. Following mobilization into the circulation and after an average of 10 days, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are collected through leuko-apheresis. The autoreactive immune cells are systematically depleted from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymphoid tissue and the CNS through the infusion of several immunodepleting drugs (conditioning regimen). According to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidelines, there are three grades of intensity of conditioning regimens (high, intermediate and low-intensity protocols), according to the degree of myelotoxicity and immunodepletion. Then, HSPs are re-infused together via hydration, antiemetics and other supportive care measures reducing the effects of the dimethyl-sulfoxide and cytolysis debris. The engraftment typically occurs on average within 10–15 days. Then, the patient can be discharged and monitored for potential late adverse events (follow-up).\n\n### 5.1. Mobilisation of HSPs\n\nMobilization is usually realized through the administration of chemotherapy, mainly cyclophosphamide (Cy) with the dosage of 2–4 g/m2, followed by daily granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with the dosage of 5–10 μg/kg daily, until harvest completion. As an alternative, although G-CSF could be used alone, the combination with priming chemotherapy should be favored as it is associated with a lower risk of disease flares and the percentage of potential auto-reactive cells in the graft [[18](#B18-jcm-11-00942)]. Cy or steroids may also prevent a possible exacerbation of MS induced by the G-CSF and allow for more effective mobilization, resulting in a lower burden of lymphocytes in the graft and better control of the disease [[18](#B18-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 5.2. HSPs Collection\n\nFollowing mobilization into the circulation and after an average of 10 days, HSPs are collected through leuko-apheresis. The optimal target is about 5 × 106/kg of body weight with a minimum safety threshold of 2 × 106/kg [[17](#B17-jcm-11-00942)]. The HSPs are collected through multiple aspirations from the bone marrow of the iliac crests or via apheresis from peripheral blood after mobilization into the circulation [[19](#B19-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nHSPs and progenitor cells mobilized into the bloodstream represent the most frequently used resource for MS patients receiving HSCT. Indeed, the higher proportion of progenitor cells and the more rapid engraftment may reduce the risk of neutropenic infections. Afterward, it is possible to manipulate, cryopreserve and store the HSP graft, until HSPs infusion [[20](#B20-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe selection of immune cells consists of removing them from the graft product through a positive selection of hematopoietic stem and precursor cells that selectively express CD34+ antigen on the surface. Several clinical-scale devices are utilized to selectively deplete the immune cells using immunomagnetic separation. After the incubation of the cells in the HSPs graft with an antibody to CD34 covalently bound to a paramagnetic bead, those cells that express CD34 are selectively retained while the remaining cells (including lymphocytes and monocytes) are wiped out thanks to the passage of the cell suspension through a column in a magnetic field [[19](#B19-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 5.3. Conditioning Regimen\n\nThe conditioning regimen aims to systematically deplete the autoreactive immune cells from the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow and the CNS. The kind of regimen used may vary regionally [[4](#B4-jcm-11-00942),[21](#B21-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidelines classified the conditioning regimens in three grades of intensity (high-, intermediate- and low-intensity protocols) based on the degree of myelotoxicity and immunodepletion. The high-intensity protocol includes total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan combined with Cy (Bu-Cy), each of which is possibly associated with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Doses used for TBI ranged between 12 and 15 Gy, given in 8 to 12 fractions over 4 days, with two to three treatments daily. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) recommends the use of <20 cGy/min in order to reduce the risk of complications [[22](#B22-jcm-11-00942)]. Doses higher than 15 Gy were shown to decrease the relapse rate while increasing the incidence of graft disease and mortality. Low-dose TBI consisting of 2 to 8 Gy given in one to four fractions, in combination with chemotherapy, was demonstrated to be an effective conditioning regimen for HSCT in patients who cannot tolerate myeloablation [[23](#B23-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe intermediate intensity protocol can be further divided into myeloablative or non-myeloablative. In the myeloablative protocol, HSPs are reinfused in order to recover from the aplastic phase. It may consist of a BEAM protocol that includes bischloro-ethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU) 300 mg/m2, cytosinearabinoside 200/800 mg/m2, etoposide 200/800 mg/m2 and melphalan 140 mg/m2 associated with ATG. In the non-myeloablative protocol, consisting of Cy 200 mg/m2 and ATG, the recovery of hematopoiesis is usually spontaneous and the reinfusion of HSPs is able to reduce the aplastic phase and the related risks. Finally, the low-intensity protocol includes chemotherapy only (e.g., Cy 100 mg/kg) and is not associated with serotherapy [[24](#B24-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 5.4. HPSs Reinfusion\n\nFollowing the conditioning, HSPs are reinfused that is usually with hydration, antiemetics and other supportive care measures that are aimed to contain the adverse events of the dimethyl-sulfoxide and cytolysis debris. The engraftment typically occurs on average within 10–15 days [[17](#B17-jcm-11-00942),[24](#B24-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe stem cell infusion (also called “day 0” of the new immune system) is a relatively simple procedure that is usually performed at the bedside, followed by the administration of supportive treatments and anti-microbial prophylaxis during the aplastic phase and the recovery. Between 10–14 days after the procedure, pancytopenia usually requires irradiated red cell and platelet transfusions, while menstrual bleeding could be prevented by the use of hormonal therapy. Prophylactic and therapeutic anti-infective agents (antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal) are also used in order to cover immunosuppressed periods.\n\nThe grafted cells settle in the bone marrow and start replacing the blood cells in about 2 weeks. The complete immune reconstitution and patient systemic and neurological restoration usually take 12 months or longer [[17](#B17-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n## 6.

Relapses\n\nOur monocentric experience is in line with several meta-analyses that provided evidence that AHSCT can induce long-term remissions for MS patients and confirmed the efficacy of HSCT against MS relapses [[39](#B39-jcm-11-00942),[40](#B40-jcm-11-00942)]. Indeed, the current literature shows that AHSCT is able to induce complete remission of clinical relapses in 70–100% of treated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. In particular, the relapse-free survival rates ranged from 80% at 4 years to 100% at a median of 6.7 years of follow-up [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942),[35](#B35-jcm-11-00942),[41](#B41-jcm-11-00942)]. This massive anti-inflammatory effect was observed in MS patients with highly active disease prior to AHSCT, as shown by the median/mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the previous year ranging from 1.2 to 8 [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)]. In another study, high-intensity AHSCT consistently reduced the ARR from 167 relapses over 146 patient-years before the AHSCT procedure to zero over 179 patient-years at the follow-up [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nOther studies showed that the ARR following AHSCT was markedly reduced, ranging from zero to values below 0.05 [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)]; the ARRs reported by the pivotal trials of highly effective DMTs, although lower than the pre-treatment values, were considerably higher than those reported in AHSCT studies, which ranged between 0.16 and 0.34 [[42](#B42-jcm-11-00942),[43](#B43-jcm-11-00942),[44](#B44-jcm-11-00942),[45](#B45-jcm-11-00942)]. However, such results should be considered with caution [[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 6.2. Disability\n\nSeveral studies demonstrated that AHSCT is able to achieve progression-free survival values of up to 100% at 10 years, with a reduction of long-term disability progression in at least 40% of patients [[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)]. In particular, in RRMS patients, the progression-free survival ranged from 73% to 100% at 5 years, which was maintained for up to 10 years in one study [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942),[35](#B35-jcm-11-00942)]. In another recent cohort where RRMS patients were treated with a BEAM+ATG conditioning protocol, disability-worsening-free survival was reached in 85.5% (range 76.9–94.1%) at 5 years and in 71.3% (range 57.8–84.8%) of patients at 10 years [[36](#B36-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nA considerably lower progression-free survival was found in another study showing that 43% of the seven RRMS patients enrolled were progression-free at 5 years [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)]. However, the authors assumed that this result was due to the higher disability of the patients at baseline (the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ranged between 6 and 7); thus, it could be hypothesized that these patients might have entered the secondary progressive (SPMS) phase early after the enrolment [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nStudies evaluating AHSCT in progressive MS patients showed progression-free survival values ranging from 33% at 5 years to 78.7% at 8 years [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[31](#B31-jcm-11-00942)]. In a recent study that included 26 SPMS patients with moderate–severe disability, mostly exhibiting signs of clinical or MRI inflammatory activity at the time of the AHSCT, the progression-free survival at years 5 and 10 was 42% and 30%, respectively [[37](#B37-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn a retrospective study of 120 MS patients (52% with progressive MS (secondary or primary)) treated with AHSCT, 90% at 2 years and 85% at 4 years showed no new MRI lesions, with a progression-free survival of about 75% at 2 years and 65% at 4 years [[35](#B35-jcm-11-00942)]. In a recent Italian study, disability-worsening-free survival was 71.0% (range 59.4–82.6%) and 57.2% (range 41.8–72.7%) at 5 and 10 years [[36](#B36-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nHowever, AHSCT is not recommended by EBMT guidelines in primary progressive MS (PPMS) since registry studies did not demonstrate acceptable levels of effectiveness [[21](#B21-jcm-11-00942),[24](#B24-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nConfirmed disability improvement was investigated in several studies [[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)]. Particularly, it was more frequently reported in RRMS patients and predominantly within the first year after AHSCT. Moreover, a study showed a reduction of at least 1 EDSS point at 1 year in about 50% of patients, and this improvement was constant up to 5 years of follow-up [[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942)]. Another study of 111 RRMS patients demonstrated a significant improvement in EDSS after transplantation [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. In particular, during the 12 months before AHSCT, the mean EDSS score was increased by 0.94 points; in contrast, during the 12 months after AHSCT, a mean decrease of 0.32 points was observed. Interestingly, although the improvement in EDSS between the pre- and post-treatment periods was higher in relapsing MS patients, a significant change was also found in progressive MS [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. In addition, the reduction in the median EDSS was also confirmed in other studies showing a change ranging from −0.75 (range −7 to 1.5) to −3.0 points, with a more pronounced decrease in RRMS [[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nFurthermore, Neurological Rating Scale (NRS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scores were found to be significantly improved in patients who underwent AHSCT in several reports [[28](#B28-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nSeveral studies investigating the effect of AHSCT on quality of life reported an improvement in both physical and mental health domains in all MS phenotypes, even if it was more marked in RRMS patients [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942),[31](#B31-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)]. In the Canadian AHSCT study of 23 patients who underwent AHSCT, the median Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) score showed a decrease of 36%, with four patients having a 100% reduction [[47](#B47-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nFinally, after AHSCT, 37% of patients in another study improved their functional capacity, where they were able to return to daily life, including returning to work or school [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 6.3. MRI Activity\n\nThe intermediate-intensity conditioning AHSCT was able to induce a consistent reduction in the gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) lesions up to 99% compared with the pre-treatment count using a triple dose of gadolinium (Gd) [[35](#B35-jcm-11-00942)]. Similarly, in another study that analyzed 327 MRI scans of 23 patients treated with a high-intensity AHSCT regimen, no signs of MRI activity were detected in comparison with the high disease activity documented prior to AHSCT [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)]. Moreover, in a study using the BEAM/ATG regimen, the mean pre-treatment Gd+ lesion count was reduced by over 90%, with a consistent decrease from 1.32 to 0.07 after 6 months and to 0.08 at the last follow-up [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942)]. Other reports demonstrated a reduction in the median T2 lesion volume of 33% after 27 months and of 2.8% after 6 months and at the last follow-up [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn contrast, in another study of seven patients who received a low-intensity regimen, the mean number of Gd+ lesions per month and per patient fell from 4.1 before treatment to 0.2 after 3 years using a triple dose of Gd [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)]. In this study, the complete remission of MRI activity was achieved in only one patient, suggesting a milder effect on inflammatory lesion activity following a low-intensity conditioning regimen [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 6.4. Disease Activity Free Survival\n\nNo evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) was defined as the absence of relapse, EDSS progression and MRI activity (new T2 lesions and Gd+ lesions) [[48](#B48-jcm-11-00942)]. According to the current literature, over 60% of patients who underwent AHSCT showed NEDA at 3 years, reaching 70% at 10 years in only one study enrolling a small cohort of RRMS patients [[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)]. In contrast to these studies, another report showed that, out of the seven patients enrolled, one experienced relapse, four experienced disease progression and six experienced MRI activity at 5 years of follow-up [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942)]. However, it should be noted that the use of a triple dose of Gd may have potentiated the detection of MRI activity in this study, as it is usually able to detect 75% more lesions than the standard dose [[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942),[49](#B49-jcm-11-00942)]. In another recent Italian study of 122 RRMS patients treated with the BEAM/ATG conditioning protocol, the risk of NEDA-3 failure was markedly reduced (HR = 0.27 [0.14–0.50], *p* < 0.001) [[36](#B36-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nFurthermore, a recent meta-analysis showed that patients treated with AHSCT achieved higher values of NEDA compared with those treated with currently approved DMTs [[50](#B50-jcm-11-00942)]. Similarly, in a monocentric registry-based cohort study, significantly more patients reached NEDA in the AHSCT group (*p* < 0.05) compared with the alemtuzumab-treated group [[51](#B51-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 6.5. Brain Atrophy\n\nIt is known that MS patients exhibit higher rates of brain volume loss (BVL) than in healthy controls; moreover, brain atrophy correlates with long-term disability and cognitive decline [[52](#B52-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nDifferent imaging techniques were developed in order to evaluate the BVL between two time points, and several corresponding pathological cut-offs have recently been introduced [[53](#B53-jcm-11-00942),[54](#B54-jcm-11-00942),[55](#B55-jcm-11-00942)]. Particularly, yearly values of BVL were −0.49 ± 0.65% and −0.64 ± 0.68% for RRMS and SPMS, respectively, in a large cohort of untreated MS patients [[56](#B56-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nSeveral studies adopting high-intensity regimens for AHSCT showed that, in the short term, the rates of BVL decreased to −3.2% over a median time of 2.4 months, with −15.1% per year and of −2.33% from month 1 to month 12 of follow-up [[57](#B57-jcm-11-00942),[58](#B58-jcm-11-00942)]. Long-term analysis of the HALT-MS (High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis) study demonstrated that the decrease in brain volume predominantly occurred within 6 months; then, this rate slowed after 3 years and became stable until 5 years after AHSCT [[28](#B28-jcm-11-00942),[59](#B59-jcm-11-00942)]. Furthermore, another study confirmed the high rates of BVL during the first 6 months after Bu-Cy AHSCT, followed by a stabilization beyond 24 months with −0.32 ± 0.67% by reaching similar values to normal aging healthy individuals [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn order to provide an explanation about the high rates of BVL reported within the first months after AHSCT, several mechanisms were suggested. Each of these hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, may contribute to a different degree to the BVL, relying on individual patients’ characteristics and the treatment agents for the regimen. First, it is possible that the brain atrophy observed in the short term could be due to the remission of inflammation within the brain parenchyma that, in turn, reduces the tissue edema (so-called “pseudo-atrophy”). Second, the ongoing reduction of brain tissue could be already present at baseline and potentially accelerated by neurotoxicity of the AHSCT regimen [[37](#B37-jcm-11-00942)]. More recently, a study of 19 patients, with 12 RRMS and 7 SPMS, treated with high-intensity AHSCT proposed a four-component model [[60](#B60-jcm-11-00942)]. According to the authors, both neurotoxicity and sustained degeneration of damaged brain tissue might contribute to the initial acceleration of BVL [[60](#B60-jcm-11-00942)]. In summary, although the BVL rates detected within the first months after AHSCT were higher than those found in untreated MS patients, they slowed down after a period of 2–3 years, achieving values similar to the healthy population. Thus, this may suggest that effective remission of inflammation could reduce the BVL rates to normal value, at least in selected patients [[60](#B60-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nVariations of the lateral ventricular volume, a validated marker of BVL, were estimated in 24 patients treated with BEAM-AHSCT, showing in 75% of them (either RR- or SPMS) that the annualized values were below the pathological threshold [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942)]. Furthermore, changes in normalized corpus callosum area were comparable to pre-treatment values within 2.5 years after AHSCT, reducing to zero thereafter; at up to 10 years of follow-up, only two of ten patients showed ongoing atrophy [[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n## 7. Safety of AHSCT in Multiple Sclerosis\n\nThe main AHSCT-related complications in MS are illustrated in [Table 3](#jcm-11-00942-t003).\n\n### Table 3.\n\nAHSCT-related complications commonly associated with MS patients.\n\n|  | MS Risk Factor | Measure to Prevent/Treat |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Early AEs |  | |\n| ATG fever  [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942)] | Cytokine release | Steroids, antipyretics |\n| Worsening of neurological symptoms  [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Fever | Treat cause of fever |\n| LUTS  [[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Neurologic bladder | Antimicrobials Rehydration |\n| Hemorrhagic cystitis [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Neurologic bladder | Urinary catheter, rehydration |\n| EBV/CMV reactivation [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Previous exposure to EBV/CMV | Monitoring of EBV/CMV DNA |\n| Pneumonia [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Muscular weakness, immobility | Antimicrobials, early mobilization |\n| Deep vein thrombosis [[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)] | Immobility | Early mobilization, anticoagulants |\n| Falls  [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)] | Muscular weakness, dehydration | Physiotherapy, fluid monitoring |\n| Late AEs |  | |\n| PML [[63](#B63-jcm-11-00942),[64](#B64-jcm-11-00942),[65](#B65-jcm-11-00942)] | Positive antibodies against JCV, previous treatment with natalizumab | Wash-out after the withdrawal of natalizumab, JCV testing prior to the AHSCT procedure |\n| Varicella zoster reactivation [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)] | Immunosuppression | Antiviral prophylaxis |\n| Secondary autoimmune diseases [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[66](#B66-jcm-11-00942),[67](#B67-jcm-11-00942),[68](#B68-jcm-11-00942)] | Pretreatment with ALM or ATG | Close follow-up |\n| Premature menopause and infertility [[42](#B42-jcm-11-00942),[68](#B68-jcm-11-00942),[69](#B69-jcm-11-00942),[70](#B70-jcm-11-00942)] | Older age, high intensity of the conditioning regimen | Counseling, adoption of fertility preservation strategies |\n| Malignancies [[25](#B25-jcm-11-00942),[26](#B26-jcm-11-00942),[28](#B28-jcm-11-00942),[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942),[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[31](#B31-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942),[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942),[71](#B71-jcm-11-00942)] | Allogeneic HSCT, previous use of immunosuppressive drugs | Close follow-up |\n\nAHSCT: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, AE: adverse event, ALM: alemtuzumab, ATG: anti-thymocyte globulin, EBV: Epstein–Barr virus, CMV: cytomegalovirus, JCV: John Cunningham virus, LUTS: lower urinary tract symptoms, MS: multiple sclerosis; PML: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n\n### 7.1. Early Complications\n\nThe AHSCT procedure includes the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy that may cause several common adverse effects (AEs), such as anaphylactic reactions, neutropenic fever, infections and sepsis, gastrointestinal toxicity and viral reactivations (particularly Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, etc.) [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[61](#B61-jcm-11-00942),[62](#B62-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nNeutropenic fever and/or sepsis require immediate assessment, clinical examination and a prompt therapeutic approach with antibiotics; in case this condition significantly persists even beyond the conditioning phase, it should also be evaluated whether it could be related to the effect of AHSCT. Corticosteroids and paracetamol may help to prevent prolonged pyrexia when the presence of infections is excluded [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)]. Moreover, peri-transplant-sustained pyrexia, aside from being a possible infective cause, correlated with poor long-term neurological recovery [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)]. Indeed, patients who underwent AHSCT may experience a transient neurological worsening; in particular, fever secondary to the AHSCT and/or to infection may worsen neurological symptoms, such as spasticity, pain, urinary symptoms, weakness and fatigue. For this reason, therapeutic interventions should be promptly carried out to prevent prolonged pyrexia, whatever might be the cause.\n\n### 7.2. Late Complications\n\nOne of the most common late complications of AHSCT is the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, possibly secondary to the significant immunosuppression related to the conditioning regimen [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nAmong viral reactivations, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a severely disabling and potentially life-threatening disease caused by the reactivation of John Cunningham virus (JCV), mainly in immunosuppressed patients, has raised concerns in the last decade as a potential adverse event of several DMTs, particularly natalizumab [[63](#B63-jcm-11-00942),[64](#B64-jcm-11-00942),[65](#B65-jcm-11-00942)]. According to the current literature, only one case of PML has been reported 11 years after an AHSCT in a patient who had received natalizumab treatment for about 3 years, and thus, it could not be considered as related to the AHSCT [[71](#B71-jcm-11-00942)]. Therefore, to date, no cases of PML associated with AHSCT have been reported so far in MS patients. However, the PML risk could be mitigated by adopting adequate wash-out periods after the discontinuation of highly active DMTs potentially at risk of PML and/or dosing the titer of antibodies against JCV prior to the AHSCT procedure.\n\nFollowing AHSCT, a higher percentage of MS patients compared to the oncologic setting exhibits secondary autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and acquired anti-factor VIII inhibitor diseases [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[66](#B66-jcm-11-00942),[72](#B72-jcm-11-00942)]. In a retrospective analysis of patients from the EBMT and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) databases, the incidence of autoimmune AEs mainly consists of thyroiditis, with 5% over a median follow-up of 6.6 years after AHSCT [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[67](#B67-jcm-11-00942)]. Higher rates (26% and 23%) were reported in a subgroup of patients who had performed the ex vivo manipulation of the graft and in a cohort who had received a conditioning regimen that included alemtuzumab, respectively [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nHowever, patients treated with alemtuzumab showed higher rates of autoimmune AEs compared to those receiving AHSCT, with almost half of the patients developing a secondary autoimmune condition at 2 years from the second alemtuzumab course [[73](#B73-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nLong-term potential AEs also include effects on fertility and the occurrence of malignancies. For female patients of childbearing potential who underwent AHSCT, the high risk of premature menopause and infertility represents a relevant concern. The risk is significantly associated with the age at transplant, with patients older than 30 years showing the highest risk, and the intensity of the conditioning regimen [[74](#B74-jcm-11-00942)]. Nevertheless, a retrospective analysis of 324 women treated with AHSCT for autoimmune diseases reported 15 pregnancies, 11 of them terminated with 7 healthy live births [[68](#B68-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nA multicenter study reported on post-AHSCT menstrual resumption in 43 MS female patients showing that 30 (70%) started menstruating again after a mean time of 6.8 months [[69](#B69-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nMoreover, in a phase 2 trial of AHSCT for MS, out of 55 patients enrolled, 33 were women and had undergone AHSCT while being of childbearing age at the time of the AHSCT procedure. In a study reporting the outcomes of four pregnancies that occurred after AHSCT, two of them were carried to term with no maternal or neonatal complications. The remaining were not carried to term due to elective termination. In this study, out of 21 males enrolled, one patient has fathered three children since his AHSCT. No newborn complications were reported [[70](#B70-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nData about male fertility after AHSCT are scarce; however, AHSCT seems to only minimally affect reproductive functions. A small study that enrolled four males who underwent a procedure with Cy and ATG for autoimmune diseases showed a reduction in testosterone compared with baseline values. However, the levels of testosterone remained within the normal range in three patients [[42](#B42-jcm-11-00942)]. Potential complications on the reproductive functions and the possible adoption of fertility preservation strategies should be extensively discussed with patients who are potentially eligible for AHSCT.\n\nFew studies have described the occurrence of tumors following AHSCT. In a recent retrospective study, malignancies were diagnosed in 3.2% of patients (9 of 281 treated patients) [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. In this analysis, with the exception of three cases of myelodysplastic syndromes typically associated with exposure to cytotoxic drugs, no organ-specific prevalence was detected [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. Moreover, in the current literature, six malignancies occurred, where one of them was reported in a patient treated with DMT after AHSCT [[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[71](#B71-jcm-11-00942)]. Notably, an increased risk of malignancies was reported in patients who received allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) [[75](#B75-jcm-11-00942)]. Similarly, some studies suggested that treatments received prior to AHSCT might play a role in the global cancer risk as MS patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs were more at risk of malignancies, possible due to a reduction in immunosurveillance [[76](#B76-jcm-11-00942),[77](#B77-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nThe risk of mortality represents the main concern limiting the use of AHSCT for MS treatment. Procedures performed between 1995 and 2000 showed transplant-related mortality of 7.3%, 1.3% between 2001 and 2007 and 0.7% between 2008 and 2016, with a dramatic decline in the last decade, where it progressively reduced to 0.2% (1/439) [[78](#B78-jcm-11-00942)]. Across the studies, overall mortality was 2.0% in 829 MS patients transplanted and 2.8% of 281 treated in two retrospective studies [[4](#B4-jcm-11-00942),[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. A higher rate (4%) was reported in another study; in this analysis, one of the 24 deaths was attributed to hepatic necrosis following busulfan-related sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Thereafter, during the study, in order to reduce regimen-related toxicity, the dose and route of administration of busulfan were changed [[27](#B27-jcm-11-00942)]. In most of the remaining studies, the mortality was 0% [[25](#B25-jcm-11-00942),[26](#B26-jcm-11-00942),[28](#B28-jcm-11-00942),[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942),[30](#B30-jcm-11-00942),[31](#B31-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[34](#B34-jcm-11-00942),[46](#B46-jcm-11-00942),[71](#B71-jcm-11-00942)]. According to recent meta-analyses, patients with specific clinical and demographic features, such as higher disability at baseline, older age and a non-RRMS course, were associated with higher mortality risk [[39](#B39-jcm-11-00942),[40](#B40-jcm-11-00942),[79](#B79-jcm-11-00942)]. Moreover, high intensity of the conditioning regimens was associated more frequently with higher rates of mortality (3.13% for high vs. 0.97% for low-to-intermediate intensity). Interestingly, patients who received AHSCT before 2006 were at higher risk, with a significant chronological improvement in the more recent 5-year epochs from 1994 to 2015, probably thanks to a better selection of eligible patients and improving expertise of transplant centers [[79](#B79-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n### 7.3. COVID-19\n\nIn the last two years, coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic threatening global health, as well as affecting the therapeutic management for MS [[80](#B80-jcm-11-00942)]. During the pandemic, a retrospective Italian study found that most of the currently used DMTs were acceptably safe, bringing out some specific elements of risk concerning the use of anti-CD20 drugs [[81](#B81-jcm-11-00942)]. COVID-19 has a great impact on HSCT activity worldwide; the EBMT has, therefore, developed recommendations for transplant programs and physicians caring for these patients [[82](#B82-jcm-11-00942)]. Patients receiving AHSCT for hematological diseases showed a protracted duration of COVID-19 symptoms and a higher risk of generation of highly mutated viruses. Moreover, several studies demonstrated a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients receiving HSCT; however, older age, the presence of comorbid conditions and the immunosuppression due to both treatments and underlying hematological malignancy may also contribute to a more severe COVID-19 course [[83](#B83-jcm-11-00942)]. Particularly, the mortality rate was 11.5% in patients who were not treated with immunosuppressive drugs at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, while it rose to 33% in those who were immunosuppressed [[84](#B84-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn the MS setting, not enough data are available in order to define the risk profile of AHSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reports from the current literature do not suggest a more severe course and higher mortality rates in MS patients who have received AHSCT and faced SARS-CoV-2 infection [[81](#B81-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n## 8. AHSCT and Vaccination\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no data are available about the effect of AHSCT on vaccination response in MS [[85](#B85-jcm-11-00942)]. However, even considering patients receiving transplants for hematological diseases, the literature is scarce and consensus on the timing of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation vaccination is currently lacking. In a recent review, it was reported that patients receiving allo-HSCT had a 12 months post-transplant response to influenza vaccine of over 45% that ranged between 10 and 97% at 7–48 months. The response to pneumococcal vaccination at 3–25 months post transplant was 43–99%, increasing over time. For diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hemophilus Influenzae type b vaccinations the response ranged from 26 to 100% after 6–17 months from the transplant. The rate of response after meningococcal vaccination at 12 months post transplant was 65%; whilst the hepatitis B vaccine at 6–23 months produced a response in 40–94%. Similarly, measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations at 41–69 months post transplant showed a response in 19–72%. In general, in patients receiving AHSCT, the responses were slightly higher when compared with allo-HSCT [[86](#B86-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nInitial reports on the antibody response after full SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in hematological patients showed that antibody response rates were lower compared with the healthy population. In a prospective study of the Spanish Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Group (GETH-TC) on a large cohort of patients with different diseases (most of them with onco-hematological conditions), 242 (78%) of patients who received allo-HSCT and 73 (85%) of those who have received AHSCT showed detectable SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies [[87](#B87-jcm-11-00942)]. Most patients received mRNA-based vaccines and were vaccinated more than 1 year after transplantation [[87](#B87-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n## 9. Factors Influencing the Success of AHSCT and Choice of Conditioning Regimen\n\nSeveral baseline characteristics were identified as predictive factors for the AHSCT outcome. Some studies demonstrated that a progressive phenotype was associated with a higher risk of post-AHSCT progression (HR 2.33, 95%CI 1.27–4.28) compared with relapsing MS [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[32](#B32-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[88](#B88-jcm-11-00942)]. On the other hand, short disease duration, younger age at the time of the AHSCT and a lower number of previous DMTs correlated with a positive outcome [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942)]. This was confirmed by a recent retrospective study in which 20 patients with “aggressive” MS underwent AHSCT as a first therapeutic choice. After a median follow-up of 30 (12–118) months, the median EDSS score markedly reduced from 5.0 (1.5–9.5) at baseline to 2.0 (0–6.5), and no patient exhibited further relapses. MRI showed residual disease activities in three patients during the first 6 months after AHSCT, while no further new or enhancing lesions were detected in subsequent scans [[41](#B41-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn general, these studies contribute toward providing an outline of the “ideal candidate” profile for the AHSCT, suggesting that younger age, highly inflammatory-active MS, mild disability progression and no multiple treatments failure are distinctive elements of better outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety profile following AHSCT [[4](#B4-jcm-11-00942)].\n\n## 10. Cost Effectiveness\n\nIn contrast to ongoing repeated treatment with currently approved DMTs, AHSCT represents a “one-off” treatment, providing therapeutic benefits in carefully selected patients. Several studies reported favorable cost-effectiveness in MS patients receiving AHSCT and showing a sustained response compared with some DMTs [[89](#B89-jcm-11-00942),[90](#B90-jcm-11-00942)]. Although list prices of MS DMTs, ranging from USD 50,000 to USD 70,000 per year in the USA, are apparently lower, the cost of AHSCT (about USD 120,000) is incurred mainly during the first year with minimal subsequent direct costs [[91](#B91-jcm-11-00942)]. Similarly, a UK study showed that the annual costs of second-line DMTs with a long-term schedule of administration, such as natalizumab, fingolimod and ocrelizumab, range from GBP 14,730 to GBP 19,169. Conversely, a complete course of DMTs with an expected long-standing effect costs about GBP 55,000, in particular, GBP 56,360 for alemtuzumab and GBP 50,157 for a 2-year course of cladribine in a patient with an average weight of 70 kg [[92](#B92-jcm-11-00942)]. Furthermore, in a study of SPMS patients with moderate-to-severe disability receiving AHSCT, with a cost of GBP 30,000, the transplant appeared to be more cost-effective than the mitoxantrone (indirect comparator) in two of three scenarios evaluated [[89](#B89-jcm-11-00942)]. The comparator prevailed on AHSCT only when considering the short duration of the effect (sustained for 5 years only). Thus, it is conceivable that the long-standing effect of AHSCT and decrease in mortality rates may contribute to an acceptable cost-effectiveness balance.\n\n## 11. Discussion\n\nIn the last few years, the efficacy and safety of the AHSCT procedure for MS treatment have been widely explored, particularly by open-label studies and randomized clinical trials [[25](#B25-jcm-11-00942),[28](#B28-jcm-11-00942),[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942)]. However, no clear conclusions could be drawn, mainly due to the small number of patients included in the studies and the high variability in terms of the clinical characteristics and regimens used for AHSCT.\n\nOne of the most important advantages of the AHSCT procedure is the direct effect on the CNS. Indeed, the high efficacy of the AHSCT procedure could rely on the effect on the inflammatory cells in the CNS, which are considered to be the main driver of demyelination and axonal damage. To confirm this, data from studies in an oncological setting showed that, after intravenous administration, busulfan diffuses across the BBB with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma ratio of 0.95 [[93](#B93-jcm-11-00942)]. In contrast, the activity of DMTs for MS is mainly confined to the peripheral immune compartment, as most of them do not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Thus, it is conceivable that the pathological increase in BBB permeability observed in active MS patients may affect the drugs’ penetration into the CNS, even if no data supporting this hypothesis are available. This mechanism may be responsible for the potential high efficacy of AHSCT on disability shown in the majority of the studies given that most of the patients eligible for AHSCT typically exhibit aggressive, highly active MS, with some not responding to the approved DMTs [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942),[33](#B33-jcm-11-00942),[39](#B39-jcm-11-00942),[40](#B40-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nConsidering the protocol regimens (high, intermediate or low), there is no consensus as to which of them is superior. This is because of the lack of studies directly comparing these different HSCT conditioning regimens on MS outcomes and the high heterogeneity of the cohorts, including differences in study design, patient selection, outcome measures and length of the follow-up [[40](#B40-jcm-11-00942),[78](#B78-jcm-11-00942)]. However, higher intensity regimens seem to be more effective, resulting in more sustained disease control, even with a higher risk of infective complications and systemic toxicity [[94](#B94-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nAHSCT represents a good treatment option in light of the cost-effectiveness analyses. Indeed, highly effective second-line therapies might have a lower price, but healthcare costs and treatment management account for considerable healthcare expenses [[95](#B95-jcm-11-00942)]. As observed in most of the cost-effectiveness analyses for DMTs, treating in the early stage and during the RR phase of the disease results is more cost effective than treatments that are started in already disabled patients [[96](#B96-jcm-11-00942),[97](#B97-jcm-11-00942)]. Indeed, the disability status heavily impacts health costs due to the production losses, the decrease in work productivity and decline in utility, which are strictly associated with the increase of EDSS [[96](#B96-jcm-11-00942),[97](#B97-jcm-11-00942)]. To confirm this, a European cost-of-illness study showed that the average yearly cost was about EUR 37,100 in moderately disabled patients and EUR 57,500 in more severely disabled patients [[98](#B98-jcm-11-00942)]. In this scenario, AHSCT could have a potential advantage representing a “front-loading” strategy in which the investment of more resources at the onset of the disease, e.g., with the use of more expensive and more effective DMTs, may reduce long-term costs related to disability and associated complications [[91](#B91-jcm-11-00942),[99](#B99-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nIn light of this, studies comparing the AHSCT with high-efficacy DMTs may help to determine the place of AHSCT in the treatment pathway in patients with RRMS but also add information about the potential cost saving of AHSCT compared with more expensive DMTs. Indeed, few retrospective real-world studies have suggested a higher efficacy of AHSCT, even in terms of maintaining NEDA and cognition improvement compared with alemtuzumab [[38](#B38-jcm-11-00942),[51](#B51-jcm-11-00942),[100](#B100-jcm-11-00942)]. However, such randomized clinical trials are not available and, to date, only a multicenter, randomized, phase III trial (STAR-MS) aiming to evaluate whether AHSCT has superior clinical efficacy to highly effective DMT (alemtuzumab or ocrelizumab) is still ongoing [[101](#B101-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nAlthough the potential risk of long-term AEs and the higher rates of mortality compared with DMTs may potentially reverse these advantages, in the last few years, thanks to the increased center expertise of transplant centers and protocol refinements, these safety concerns have been mitigated by promoting programs for the long-term monitoring of various late transplant-related complications. Indeed, until recently, the AHSCT procedure was performed at transplant centers with strong experience and high expertise, with the healthcare services usually tailored for hemato-oncology patients. In the last two decades, the increasing use of the AHSCT procedure in the MS field has highlighted the need for MS-specific supportive care measures, including multidisciplinary teams, in order to improve the center experience and standard of care.\n\nFurthermore, considering that, due to the higher prevalence of MS in women, many MS patients eligible for AHSCT are at childbearing age, the risk of temporary ovarian/testicular failure and infertility secondary to AHSCT require specialist counseling. Moreover, it should be discussed whether high-efficacy DMTs are potentially associated with short- and long-term toxicities, including PML, and other serious infections, which also lead to significant morbidity and mortality rates [[102](#B102-jcm-11-00942),[103](#B103-jcm-11-00942)]. Indeed, as the main concern of AHSCT is the mortality risk, patients selected for the procedure that AHSCT should be adequately informed that AHSCT is potentially associated with a risk of mortality of approximately 1% in a hemato-oncologic setting, particularly in patients suffering from myeloma, lymphoma and solid neoplasms.\n\nRecent data about the risk of COVID-19 seem to be encouraging. Moreover, even if initial reports suggested lower antibody response rates after a full SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients suffering from hematological conditions, data from the National Registry have shown higher response rates [[87](#B87-jcm-11-00942)]. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that other powerful DMT, particularly ocrelizumab and rituximab, may compromise the vaccination response in MS patients [[104](#B104-jcm-11-00942)]. Notably, no data are available about the effect of AHSCT for MS on COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAnother challenge is whether AHSCT may be effective even in the progressive forms of MS. In the last two decades, AHSCT was used to treat a large number of patients with progressive MS, demonstrating a reduction in the ARR and the disability progression [[9](#B9-jcm-11-00942),[31](#B31-jcm-11-00942),[66](#B66-jcm-11-00942),[94](#B94-jcm-11-00942)]. Moreover, this limited therapeutic effect must be weighed against the potential higher risk of AEs, especially the fatal ones, that are typically associated with advanced disability. Although PPMS seems to not benefit from this treatment, and thus it is was not recommended in the EBMT guidelines [[21](#B21-jcm-11-00942),[24](#B24-jcm-11-00942)], recent studies have found that several DMTs, including ocrelizumab and rituximab, are effective in reducing the disability progression of PPMS, suggesting that inflammation may play a crucial role in the progressive phase of the disease [[105](#B105-jcm-11-00942),[106](#B106-jcm-11-00942),[107](#B107-jcm-11-00942),[108](#B108-jcm-11-00942)]. Thus, further randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of AHSCT in both secondary and primary progressive MS.\n\n## 12. Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, AHSCT is evolving as a relatively safe and highly effective therapeutic option, where it is able to induce rapid and sustained remission of disease activity with a significant improvement of disability. In recent years, the increased expertise of transplant centers, the improved patient selection and the proper choice of conditioning regimen has contributed to reducing the AE rates and mitigating safety concerns.\n\nData from the current literature have clearly delineated the profile of the “ideal” candidate for AHSCT. Indeed, the early stages of the disease, with predominant inflammation and low disability level, represent the optimal “window of therapeutic opportunity” in which to propose this therapeutic option [[109](#B109-jcm-11-00942)]. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving therapeutic scenario, it is common practice to offer AHSCT to transplant patients who failed multiple treatments, some of them with potential carry-over safety problems (e.g., PML for natalizumab). However, even in this setting, AHSCT showed an acceptable efficacy and safety profile, while taking into consideration careful monitoring provisions [[29](#B29-jcm-11-00942)].\n\nFinally, definitive evidence from new and ongoing clinical trials is awaited from ongoing RCTs in order to endorse AHSCT as “standard of care, clinical evidence available” for the treatment of aggressive and refractory relapsing MS patients.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors extend their appreciation to the patients for their participation.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization: F.P., C.G.C., S.T., S.A., C.F., V.C., G.M.; methodology: F.P., C.G.C., S.T., S.A., C.F., V.C., G.M.; data curation: F.P., C.G.C., S.T., S.A., C.F.; formal analysis: C.G.C., S.T., S.A.; investigation: C.G.C., S.T., S.A; writing—original draft preparation: F.P., C.G.C.; writing—review and editing: F.P., C.G.C., S.T., S.A., C.F., V.C., G.M.; visualization: F.P., C.G.C., S.T., S.A., C.F., V.C., G.M.; supervision: F.P., G.M.

The current IND application for systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis has further expanded the indication scope of SENL103 autologous T-cell injection, and will become a powerful tool for improving organ function and survival in AL patients.\n\n\n\n[2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fyaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa_senlang-biotechs-bcma-car-t-therapy-has-activity-7398946586678120448-KvKT&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fyaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa_senlang-biotechs-bcma-car-t-therapy-has-activity-7398946586678120448-KvKT&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fyaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa_senlang-biotechs-bcma-car-t-therapy-has-activity-7398946586678120448-KvKT&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fyaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa_senlang-biotechs-bcma-car-t-therapy-has-activity-7398946586678120448-KvKT&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n546 followers\n\n* [5 Posts](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fyaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_post_follow-posts)\n\n[View Profile](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/yaxin-carol-zhou-04b122aa?trk=public_post_follow-view-profile)   [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7398946586678120448&trk=public_post_follow)\n\n## Explore content categories\n\n* [Career](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/career/)\n* [Productivity](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/productivity/)\n* [Finance](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/finance/)\n* [Soft Skills & Emotional Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/soft-skills-emotional-intelligence/)\n* [Project Management](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/project-management/)\n* [Education](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/education/)\n* [Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/technology/)\n* [Leadership](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/leadership/)\n* [Ecommerce](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/ecommerce/)\n* [User Experience](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content/user-experience/)\n\n## Sign in to view more content\n\nCreate your free account or sign in to continue your search\n\n## Welcome back\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](/legal/user-agreement?trk=public_post_contextual-sign-in-modal_sign-in-modal_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy?trk=public_post_contextual-sign-in-modal_sign-in-modal_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookie-policy?trk=public_post_contextual-sign-in-modal_sign-in-modal_auth-button_cookie-policy).\n\nNew to LinkedIn?
