CARs are recombinant receptors for antigen that engage cell surface molecules through the variable region of an antibody and signal through arrayed T cell activating and costimulatory domains. CARs allow redirection of T cell cytotoxicity against any antigen of choice, independent of MHC expression. Patient T cells engineered to express CARs specific for CD19 have yielded remarkable outcomes in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies, setting off unprecedented interest in T cell engineering and cell-based cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we present the challenges to extend the use of CAR T cells to solid tumors and other pathologies. We further highlight progress in CAR design, cell manufacturing and genome editing, which in aggregate hold the promise of generating safer and more effective genetically instructed immunity. Novel engineered cell types, including innate T cell types, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived immune cells, are on the horizon, as are applications of CAR T cells to treat autoimmunity, severe infections and senescence-associated pathologies.\n\n**Keywords:** Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, CD19, genome editing, immunotherapy, tumor immunology\n\n## Introduction\n\nCD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptors (CD19 CARs) have opened a path for novel immune therapies in oncology and other fields of medicine. This therapeutic innovation is predicated on advances in genetic engineering, tumor immunology and cell manufacturing sciences [[1](#R1)–[4](#R4)]. Its foundational principles consist in genetically instructing T cells to recognize any chosen antigen, thus by-passing the restrictions of repertoire limitation and immune tolerance, and accelerating the establishment of immunity by providing potent manufactured immune cells to the patient, rather than inducing an uncertain endogenous response through active immunization. By using synthetic receptors for antigen that directly engage cell surface molecules, in contrast to the physiological T cell receptor (TCR), T cells can circumvent HLA restriction and the limitations of antigen processing [[5](#R5), [6](#R6)]. These principles, validated by targeting CD19 in B cell malignancies and T cell manufacturing implemented in the academic setting, have established CD19 CAR therapy as a prototype for synthetic immunity and a paradigm-shifting form of personalized medicine.\n\nCARs are synthetic receptors that may engage proteins, carbohydrates or glycolipids independently of antigen processing and HLA expression. Similar to the natural TCR/CD3 complex, CARs require an activating domain to couple antigen recognition to the initiation of T cell activation and cytolysis [[7](#R7)]. However, studies enabled by retroviral-mediated T cell engineering [[8](#R8)] demonstrated that the CD3-ζ chain activation domain is not sufficient to sustain T cell function in primary T cells [[9](#R9)]. Engineered costimulation [[10](#R10)] eventually provided a solution when it was integrated into a single dual-signaling receptor that enabled T cells to not only kill their targets but expand upon repeated exposure to antigen [[11](#R11)]. The path to “living drugs” was opened. We eventually renamed CD3-ζ chain fusions as first generation CARs and dual-signaling receptors as second generation CARs [[12](#R12)]. Second generation CARs are the backbone of present day CAR therapies.\n\nCD19 is a cell-surface molecule that is found in most B cell malignancies, which we initially chose as a CAR target over other B cell surface molecules such as CD20 and CD22 because of its relatively higher expression [[13](#R13), [14](#R14)]. Building on the demonstration that CD19-specific CARs could eliminate established leukemia and lymphoma in mice [[14](#R14)], Memorial Sloan Kettering, the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania undertook clinical trials in patients with refractory/relapsed CD19+ malignancies. Early anecdotal results obtained in NHL [[15](#R15)], CLL [[16](#R16)] and ALL [[17](#R17), [18](#R18)] were soon confirmed in larger single- and multi-center studies [[19](#R19)–[22](#R22)]. The first CARs to be approved by the FDA in 2017 and the EMA in 2018, were second generation CARs specific for CD19 [[4](#R4)]. Those CAR molecules encompass either a CD28 [[12](#R12)] or 4-1BB [[23](#R23)] costimulatory domain ([Figure 1A](#F1)). Four CAR products are approved to date (Tisagenlecleucel, Axicabtagene ciloleucel, Brexucabtagene autoleucel, Lisocabtagene maraleucel), for relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young-adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and certain follicular lymphomas. Several excellent clinical reviews addressing the efficacy of CD19 CAR T cells in different disease settings as well as their toxicity, which include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are available [[24](#R24)–[29](#R29)].\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/e0343570864e/nihms-1828968-f0001.jpg)\n\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/e0343570864e/nihms-1828968-f0001.jpg)\n\nCAR structure, function and design. (A) Prototypic CD19 CARs. (B) Novel 28z CAR designs. Left: 1928z CAR T cells bearing a single functional ITAM in membrane-proximal position (1XX CAR) display increased persistence while retaining strong effector functions [[41](#R41)]. Right: CARs comprising a truncated cytoplasmic IL2Rb and a YXXQ STAT3 binding motif (28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR) enable antigen-induced JAK-STAT activation [[43](#R43)]. (C) Novel BBz CAR designs. Left: Increasing ITAMs from 3 to 6 in a 4-1BB-based car (BBzz CAR) enhances antigen sensitivity and IL2 secretion [[42](#R42)]. Right: Altering the length of extracellular and intracellular domains in a 4-1BB-based CAR (BBz(86) CAR) reduced cytokine secretion and CRS severity [[44](#R44)]. Panel A has been partially published in [[37](#R37)].\n\nThe success of CD19 CAR therapy has spawned broad interest in this novel approach to immunotherapy. There are presently over 700 clinical trials listed at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), 41% of which target CD19 and the rest either hematological malignancies (32%) or solid tumors (27%) ([Figure 2A](#F2)). CD22 and CD20 have proven to be effective CAR targets in B cell malignancies, albeit to a lesser degree than CD19 [[30](#R30), [31](#R31)], while BCMA shows great promise for the treatment of multiple myeloma, with BCMA CAR T cells under consideration for approval by the FDA [[32](#R32)–[34](#R34)]. This review addresses the next frontiers and challenges facing the implementation of CAR therapy in oncology and beyond.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/c553c1d68d4e/nihms-1828968-f0002.jpg)\n\n![Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/c553c1d68d4e/nihms-1828968-f0002.jpg)\n\nSummary of clinical trials targeting CAR T cells.\n\nA. Clinical trials targeting CD19, other hematologic and solid malignancies. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): 41% of worldwide clinical trials aim at CD19 CAR T cells. This includes dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 CAR T cell treatments. 32% of all clinical trials target hematological cancers but not CD19. 27% of all clinical trials target solid tumors.\n\nB. CAR targeted antigens under clinical investigation for hematologic and solid tumors. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): Analyzing the distribution of antigens of interest used for directing CAR T cells in clinical trials, reveals that anti-CD19 scFv is the leading CAR T used (37%) followed by the anti-BCMA scFv (9%). Other CAR T cells directed to additional hematology or non-hematology antigens are lacking behind with less than 4% out of all CAR T clinical trials.\n\nC. Cell types engineered for CAR therapy. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): The majority of CAR T cells are transduced using the αβ T cell (>96%). Other cell types are starting to be investigated, accounting for 4% of listed clinical trials. These cells include: γδ T cells, NK, and NK/T cells, pluripotent stem cell-derived immune cells and monocytes.\n\n## Evolution of CAR design\n\nPresent day CARs comprise a single-chain Fv (scFv) for antigen recognition and a dual-signaling tail, typically comprising the CD3-ζ and either CD28 or 4-1BB cytoplasmic domains [[35](#R35)–[38](#R38)]. Different scaffolds, adapted to the epitope’s position on the targeted molecule, can further improve overall CAR function [[39](#R39)]. The binding domain is in some cases derived from a receptor-ligand pair or may consist in a VHH element rather than an scFv [[40](#R40)]. This architecture is modular and can be adapted to a wide range of targets ([Figure 1A](#F1)).\n\nCAR designs are evolving, utilizing affinity-optimized human binding domains and recruiting different signaling pathways (reviewed in [[37](#R37)]). One example of such evolution is the reduction of strength of activation in the potent 28z CAR design [[41](#R41)] and another its augmentation in the less potent BBz [[42](#R42)] ([Figure 1B](#F1)[C](#F1)). Other examples are the additional recruitment of jak/stat signaling in 28z CARs ([Figure 1B](#F1)) or adding spacer elements to attenuate cytokine secretion by BBz CARs ([Figure 1C](#F1)) [[43](#R43), [44](#R44)].\n\nIn contrast to the single specificity of natural T cells, CAR T cells may engage multiple antigens, through the design of multi-specific CARs or CAR co-expression. Targeting two independent antigens may reduce tumor escape and augment selective pressure on the tumor cell. The first dual-targeted CAR T cells have entered the clinic, combining two BBz CARs specific for CD19 and CD22 [[45](#R45)]. Combining a 28z CAR with a BBz CAR provides yet superior antigen sensitivity and potency, which is further enhanced by matching signaling features to antigen density [[46](#R46)]. A variant approach requires the successful recognition of two upregulated tumor antigens by two different CARs to initiate full immune cell functions, as demonstrated by Eshhar’s group using dual-targeted CAR T cells against myeloma cells. The results not only show efficient and potent CAR T but also a safe strategy sparing normal healthy tissues [[47](#R47)].\n\n## CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors\n\nThe only CAR T cells to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) at this time are directed to CD19 for the treatment of some refractory leukemias and lymphomas. Adapting CAR therapy to the treatment of solid tumors is a major goal and challenge [[48](#R48)–[51](#R51)]. The first results obtained in solid tumor trials, modeled on the successful strategies implemented for B cell malignancies, have been lackluster, pointing to the need to further improve and specifically adapt CAR therapy for solid tumors. Overcoming the mechanisms of resistance to CAR therapy already encountered in the setting of B cell malignancies is likely to help reach this goal.\n\nOne mechanism of resistance is the absence or insufficient level of expression of the CAR target in tumor cells. Reports from multiple trials have shown that up to 25% of patients treated with CD19-targeted CAR T cells relapsed with CD19-negative or CD19-low disease [[52](#R52)] This phenomenon is known as antigen escape. Another mechanism of resistance can be traced to the limited ability of CAR T cells to traffic to and infiltrate the tumor, due to physical barriers and/or an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the realm of B cell malignancies, it has been frequently noted that responses may be complete in bone marrow but not other disease sites such as lymph nodes or the retroperitoneal space [[53](#R53)]. Even infiltrated, it is to be expected that solid tumors will deploy a range of mechanisms to inhibit T cells and CAR T cells, which involve myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) [[54](#R54)]. The successful tackling of solid tumors by CAR T cells will thus entail, at the least, the Identification of suitable target antigens, enabling CAR T cells access all tumor sites and overcoming the immune suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment.\n\n### Target selection\n\nThe first attempts to tackle solid tumors replicated the approaches established in B cell malignancies, utilizing the same CAR designs (either 28z or BBz) and targeting a single antigen. While good responses have been sporadically obtained in GBM, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer [[55](#R55)], the overall responses are not comparable to CD19 CAR therapy. One limitation owes to the paucity of potential targets that, like CD19, are expressed on the surface of nearly all tumor cells and only in dispensable normal cells. Although few if any differentiation antigens meet these two criteria, some proteins overexpressed in tumors, although not tumor-specific, show promise, such as mesothelin, PSMA, GPC3 and a few others [[49](#R49)]. Targeting tumor antigens that are found in normal tissues may however be possible if one were to calibrate CAR function within a particular therapeutic window in order to limit reactivity to normal cells, carefully selecting scFv’s, signaling components and transcriptional regulation [[56](#R56)–[58](#R58)]. Antigen-specific inhibitor CARs may also come of use to protect normal tissues [[59](#R59)]. [Figure 2B](#F2) illustrates the distribution of CAR target antigens currently under clinical investigation for hematologic and solid tumors based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).\n\nCell surface antigens that are specifically modified in tumor cells are an attractive alternate class of CAR targets. Glycans, including glycolipids, N- and O-linked glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can undergo specific glycosylation in cancer cells. They include LewisY in advanced epithelial cancers, sialyl-LewisA in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, GD2 in neuroblastomas and some gliomas, and Tn-MUC1 in various adenocarcinomas. The involvement of multiple enzymes in glycan biosynthesis and their redundancy accounts for their stable expression and may diminish the risk of antigen escape. Tumor cells would indeed have to lose several of the >20 GalNAc polypeptide transferases that contribute to O-glycosylation to cease generating Tn antigen [[60](#R60), [61](#R61)]. Glycoprotein expression may however still be lost if the protein backbone were mutated (e.g., loss of MUC1 for Tn- MUC1).\n\n### Tumor infiltration\n\nLike any T cell, CAR T cells need to extravasate into the tumor site and overcome immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to be effective ([Figure 3](#F3)). Immune cell trafficking into peripheral tissues is regulated by complex signaling and physical processes that may be significantly disrupted in some tumors. The challenge posed by immunologically “cold tumors” is a general obstacle for all immunotherapies [[49](#R49)]. T cell engineering however allows for unique solutions. For example, rate limiting entry into the tumor may be alleviated in some cases by chemokine directed migration, for example by overexpressing the IL8 receptor, CXCR2R ([Figure 3A](#F3)), in CAR T cells [[62](#R62)]. Another approach is to direct CAR T cells to the tumor surroundings, for example, CAR T cells may be targeted to fibroblast associated protein (FAP), which is found in stromal fibroblasts in the TME. CAR T cells targeting FAP effectively infiltrate solid tumors but may also be myelotoxic ([Figure 3B](#F3)) [[63](#R63)]. Another approach makes use of CAR T cells secreting enzymes to forge a path, such as heparanase to degrade heparan sulfate proteoglycans ([Figure 3C](#F3)) [[64](#R64)].\n\n#### Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/9ec42714c452/nihms-1828968-f0003.jpg)\n\n![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/9ec42714c452/nihms-1828968-f0003.jpg)\n\nSelected novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors are illustrated: A. CAR-modified T cells express a chemokine receptor for increasing their ability to traffic/home to the tumor site (e.g., CXCR2). B. FAP specific CAR-T cells can direct CAR-T cells to the tumor surroundings. C. Heparanase expression enhances CAR-T cell forge a path in the TME. D. Intra-tumoral administration of CAR T cells in solid tumors. E. Combination therapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitory receptors to relieve immunosuppression. F. SiRNA to reduce receptor function or exhaustion markers (e.g., silencing the adenosine receptor). G. Engineered CAR T cells that secrete pro-inflammatory or CAR-T supporting cytokines such as IIL-2, IL-7, IL-12 or IL-15. H. A variety of metabolic strategies (e.g., L-Arginine) proposed to be integrated to optimize the manufacturing process and maximize the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells.\n\nLocal/regional CAR T cell delivery in solid tumors may not only maximize the accumulation of CAR T cells at the tumor site but also improve their safety profile by limiting their systemic distribution ([Figure 3D](#F3)). Regional CAR therapy targeting mesothelin in mesothelioma has shown potent and long-lasting CD4-dependent tumor immunity [[63](#R63)]. providing greater anti-tumor efficacy compared to intravenous administration [[64](#R64)].\n\n### Microenvironmental immune suppression\n\nTumors and their stroma attract and support a number of immunosuppressive cell types, including a heterogeneous population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, Foxp3+ Tregs, fibroblasts and platelets. A broad range of inhibitors acting on TME-associated immune suppression is under investigation [[65](#R65)]. Overcoming the TME by combining such agents with CAR T cells may prove to be beneficial ([Figure 3](#F3)). Blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints that enforce immune suppression is one promising option. Checkpoint inhibition may be achieved by combining CAR T cells with the systemic administration of immune checkpoint inhibitory antibodies [[63](#R63), [66](#R66), [67](#R67)] or in cell intrinsic fashion, by ablating for example PD-1 [[68](#R68)] or reducing its function with a dominant-negative receptor [[63](#R63)][[59](#R59)]. Interfering RNA provides another means to reduce but not fully ablate receptor function, for example silencing the adenosine receptor and other exhaustion markers such as the TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, and KLGR-1 ([Figure 3E](#F3)) [[58](#R58), [69](#R69), [70](#R70)]. Adenosine mediated T cell suppression can be counteracted in other ways as genetic targeting of A2AR using shRNA [[71](#R71)] ([Figure 3F](#F3)), or by adenosine-responding CAR by fusing the extracellular domain of adenosine receptor to intracellular costimulatory domains, thus converting switching a normally suppressive signal to an activating signal [[72](#R72)] .\n\nCAR T cells may be harnessed to reprogram the TME. For example, CAR T cells may provide local cytokine secretion, in order to enhance their infiltration, proliferation and persistence. CAR-expressing T cells can be engineered to produce a wide range of cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-2, IL-7, IL-21, and IL-15) ([Figure 3G](#F3)) or their cognate receptors, aiming to improve antitumor activity and persistence of these cells. These CAR T cells are sometimes referred to as armored CARs, fourth generation CARs or TRUCKs (T cells redirected for antigen- unrestricted cytokine initiated killing) [[73](#R73)]. For example, TRUCKs engineered to inducibly or constitutively express IL-12 have been shown to activate an innate immune anti-tumor response and modify tumor immunosuppression [[74](#R74)].\n\nThe heightened glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells may limit nutrients available to CAR T cells in the tumor bed, impeding their function or survival thus affecting the microenvironment and suppressing the immune cells [[75](#R75)]. Supplying the CAR T with nutrients using pre-treatment *in vitro* feeding or inhibiting specific metabolic pathways of the tumor has been shown to enhance CAR T survival, providing for example L-arginine to CAR T cells prior to their adoptive transfer ([Figure 3H](#F3)) [[76](#R76)]].\n\n## CAR toxicities\n\nCAR T cells are powerful immune effectors that may in some instances precipitate serious toxicities that require expert and urgent medical management [[24](#R24)–[27](#R27)]. The occurrence of these acute toxicities is still difficult to predict for any given patient and hinders the broad implementation of CAR therapies.\n\nThe first toxicity was anticipated and owes to the on-target/off-tumor of CAR T cells, resulting in B cell aplasia in the case of CD19 CARs [[14](#R14), [77](#R77), [78](#R78)]. Different approaches have been proposed to restrain toxicity to normal cells. One makes use of trans second- generation CARs with split costimulatory configuration combining conventional activating constructs with inhibitory CARs, could potentially enable greater target precision, by ensuring that the effector cells only reach full activation in the presence of a defined array of tumor-associated antigens [[79](#R79)]. Another approach incorporates inhibitory CARs to retrain T cell function [[80](#R80)–[83](#R83)]. The unknown toxicity of novel CAR T cells can also be limited by infusing T cells transiently expressing the CAR construct following RNA transfection, thus minimizing the duration of unforeseen toxicity [[84](#R84)]. In the context of solid tumors, local delivery of genetically modified T cells could also mitigate toxicities while increasing efficacy [[85](#R85)]. Another approach to lower side effects is to find the minimum effective dose. Modeling the amount of CAR T cells needed for a therapeutic effect while reducing the amount of injected CAR T cells to receive a lesser side effect was performed by Globerson Levin et al. and showed the possibility to use far less CAR-T lymphocytes than currently used [[79](#R79)].\n\nTwo other toxicities, which were not anticipated when the first CD19 CAR trials opened, have posed a greater challenge to date: cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) [[4](#R4), [86](#R86)]. Both toxicities occur early on after CAR T cell administration and may be significant in up to a third of all CAR T cell recipients. The mechanisms of CRS are starting to be well understood [[87](#R87), [88](#R88)]. Pathological cytokine secretion owes largely to interactions between CAR T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. While activated T cells produce chemokines and cytokines including IL-2, soluble IL-2R-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, soluble IL-6R, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the main source of IL6 and IL1 are macrophages in the vicinity of tumor and CAR T cells. The cornerstone of CRS management is IL6R blockade and corticosteroids [[89](#R89), [90](#R90)], but novel interventions including IL1Ra [[87](#R87), [88](#R88)], dasatinib [[91](#R91)] and others are emerging [[86](#R86), [92](#R92), [93](#R93)]. Neurotoxicity is less well understood and is mainly managed with corticosteroids [[86](#R86), [94](#R94), [95](#R95)].\n\nCAR T cell activity may be terminated by reversibly shutting off CAR signaling or irreversibly eliminating CAR T cells through the action of a suicide gene or other elimination switches [[96](#R96)]. Suicide genes can be included in the transfection construct, which trigger apoptosis upon induction with a specific drug [[92](#R92), [93](#R93)][[87](#R87), [88](#R88)].\n\nThus, while acute CAR T cell toxicity presently limits the widespread use of CAR T cells, one can anticipate this limitation being eventually removed, given the rapid progress in CAR design and our understanding of CRS pathophysiology.\n\n## CAR T cell manufacturing\n\n### T cell transduction\n\nT cell engineering was initiated with the use of γ-retroviral vectors [[6](#R6), [8](#R8)] and later extended to lentiviral vectors and DNA transposons, all of which mediate stable long-term transgene expression. Messenger RNA transfection may also be used for the purpose of transient CAR expression. Most γ-retroviral vectors are derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus, and have been optimized to promote high level transgene expression [[96](#R96)]. Three of the four FDA- approved CAR-T cell products, Breyanzi, Tecartus and Yescarta utilize γ-retroviral vectors to deliver CD19 specific CARs into T cells [[97](#R97), [98](#R98)]. Most lentiviral vectors are derived from HIV-1 and are pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope [[99](#R99)]. Both γ-retroviral and lentiviral vectors mediate high level and stable CAR expression. The constitutive expression of the fusogenic VSV-G glycoprotein has so far precluded the establishment of stable packaging cell lines, which is a significant burden for vector production, but lentiviral vectors are effective. Kymriah, the first 4-1BB CAR approved by the FDA and EMA, is a T cell product manufactured with vector produced by transient transfection [[100](#R100)]. DNA transposon-based systems, such as Sleeping Beauty (SB), have been developed to produce CAR T cells for clinical investigation and initially demonstrated modest efficacy [[101](#R101)]. When compared to viral vectors, the limitation of SB includes the low genetic transposition efficiency hence the need to propagate CAR T cells by stimulation with artificial antigen-presenting cells and cytokines resulting in extended *ex vivo* culture duration. More recently, site-specific CAR integration using targeted nucleases in conjunction with adeno-associated viral vectors as donor DNA for CAR transcription units, has enabled to tightly regulate CAR expression from the T-cell receptor α chain *(TRAC)* locus [[102](#R102)]. The site-specific double-stranded break enabled by gene editing tools such as CRISPR/cas9 and guide RNAs are subsequently repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) [[103](#R103)].\n\n### Autologous CAR T cells\n\nAutologous CAR T cell manufacturing begins with the collection of patient or donor blood or leukapheresis. CD3+ T cells are used as starting cells for CAR T cell manufacturing. Removal of tumor [[104](#R104)][[99](#R99)] cells and monocytes [[105](#R105)–[107](#R107)] can be mediated by positive selection of CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD4/CD8 T-cell selection has been shown to improve CAR T-cell manufacturing feasibility and resulted in heightened inflammatory toxicities when compared to products derived from whole apheresis, leading to dose de-escalation [[108](#R108)] in a phase I clinical trial of patients with relapsed/refractory CD22+ malignancies [[109](#R109)]. The generation of CAR T cells from a T cell population with defined properties has the potential to provide a more consistent source of material from one patient to another. It has been shown in animal models that CAR T cells derived from either TN naïve [[110](#R110)], TCM central memory [[111](#R111), [112](#R112)] or TSCM memory stem cell subsets [[113](#R113)] possess enhanced anti-tumor activities when compared to CAR T cells derived from bulk T cells. CD8 TCM subsets have also been demonstrated to be active in pre-clinical models [[111](#R111), [112](#R112), [114](#R114)]. CAR T cells derived from the CD62L+ TCM subset have been used in the clinical setting in patients with glioblastoma and promoted tumor regression in one patient [[115](#R115)]. CAR T cells with defined ratios of CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+TCM, or CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ potentially mitigate toxicity and have promoted disease-free survival upon infusion in patients with B-ALL and NHL [[112](#R112)]. The possible therapeutic benefit of T cell subsets needs to be evaluated upon long-term patient follow up and in larger patient cohorts to determine if its benefits will justify the increased complexity of the manufacturing scheme and additional costs related to the selection procedure.\n\n### T cell activation\n\nT cell activation with OKT3 antibody can be modulated with costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Off-the-shelf cGMP beads conjugated with anti-CD3 and anti- CD28 antibodies have been developed to optimize T-cell selection and expansion *ex vivo* (magnetic Dynabeads™ [[116](#R116)], T-cell TransAct™ biodegradable nanobeads) [[117](#R117), [118](#R118)]and are widely used for the activation of T cells in the context of clinical CAR T cell manufacturing [[109](#R109)].\n\nAlternatively, artificial antigen presenting cells (AAPCs) such as the K562 CML cells have been customized and decorated with costimulatory molecules to activate and expand subsets of T cells such as CD8+, antigen-specific and CD19-CAR-T cells [[111](#R111), [119](#R119)]. Irradiated autologous PBMCs [[120](#R120)] alone or together with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific LCLs [[121](#R121)] in combination with OKT3 antibody and IL2 have also been used to generate CD19- and CD20-specific CAR T cells, respectively. Nonetheless, the number of clinical applications with AAPCs as T cell activators is rather limited due to the complexity of generating AAPCs according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).\n\n### T cell expansion\n\nSeveral platforms such as static culture in flasks and bags, wave-mixed bioreactors and expansion in continuous bioreactors are available to enable manufacturing of clinical CAR T cells (reviewed in Wang and Riviere) [[117](#R117)]. Wave-mixed bioreactors are wildly used by academic centers and biotech companies for CAR T cell expansion to support early stage clinical trials [[109](#R109)]. Other integrated manufacturing platforms such as the CliniMACS Prodigy System are fully enclosed and designed to incorporate T cell selection, activation, transduction, expansion and formulation, enabling a higher degree of automation, supporting continuous cell culture, and largely decreasing interpersonal operator variability. Phase I clinical trials conducted with CD19 CAR T cells manufactured in the CliniMACS Prodigy have generated encouraging clinical responses which have the potential to enable the concept of point-of-care manufacturing [[122](#R122)–[126](#R126)]. Another newly available integrated end-to-end cell manufacturing solution is the Cocoon platform, which is currently being investigated in a clinical trial at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel [[127](#R127)]([NCT02772198](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02772198)). The need to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of autologous patient derived T cells is prompting the development of new culture reagents, technologies, and manufacturing platforms [[128](#R128)]. In particular, minimally manipulated CAR T cells kept in culture for less than 24hr have demonstrated some level of anti-tumor activities in animal models and in human subjects. The optimization of this approach could simplify CAR-T manufacturing and has the potential to drastically decrease the overall cost [[129](#R129), [130](#R130)].\n\n### Allogeneic CAR T cells\n\nWhile autologous CAR T cell therapies require a bespoke manufacturing process for every patient leukapheresis, off-the-shelf and allogeneic CAR therapies offer the prospect of eluding the variable quality and impairment of patient T cells, reducing the variability in yield and homogenizing the phenotype of infused CAR T cells. Allogeneic CAR T cells would also shorten the delay to T cell infusion once CAR T cells were prescribed. Allogeneic approaches however face two major challenges. The first is the risk of causing graft- versus-host disease (GVHD) and the second is the rapid elimination of allogeneic cells by the host immune system, limiting their anti-tumor activity. Several solutions are available to address the first challenge, using either allogeneic CAR T cells derived from a stem cell transplant donor, virus-specific memory T cells, non-αβ T cells and/or gene editing to ablate TCR expression, reviewed in [[131](#R131)]. The second challenge, to avoid rapid elimination, is more complex and still awaits an effective solution.\n\n### T-iPS\n\nThe generation of immune cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an alternative platform to produce “off-the-shelf” and synthetic allogeneic T-cells [[132](#R132)]. Proof-of-principle studies support the feasibility of this approach [[133](#R133), [134](#R134)]. iPS-derived NK cells have already entered the clinic ([NCT03841110](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841110)) and iPS-derived T cells will be investigated shortly in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Lymphoma ([NCT04629729](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04629729)).\n\n### In vivo CAR T cell generation\n\nCAR T cells could potentially be engineered *in vivo*, altogether by-passing *ex vivo* manufacturing. This technology is at very early stage of development and its potential remains unknown. Early studies using γ-retroviral vectors, adenoviral vectors and lipid nanoparticles, suggest the feasibility of transducing T cells in vivo [[84](#R84), [135](#R135)].\n\n## Genetic engineering and genome editing\n\nGenome editing offers new prospects for T cell engineering [[136](#R136)]. The precision afforded by CRISPR, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) is useful to not only knock-out endogenous genes but also to knock-in transgenes [[137](#R137)]. T cells edited to remove their endogenous TCR or inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 have already been tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials [[68](#R68), [138](#R138)–[140](#R140)]. The abrogation of HLA class I expression via the ablation of ß2-microglobulin is being actively pursued to build allogeneic universal CAR T cells [[141](#R141)]. These mechanisms allow efficient and relatively simple gene knock-out and are pursued for the generation of universal T cells, exhaustion- resistant T cells, and to reduce the off-target toxicity of redirected T cells by fratricide[[142](#R142)].\n\nClinical trials using either TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 for gene ablation are summarized in [[136](#R136)]. Currently 4 clinical trials make use of TALEN technology and a dozen utilize CRISPR/Cas9 to address, exhaustion, fratricide killing or allo-rejection. The preclinical results and data from early clinical trials are encouraging [[68](#R68)], but more clinical experience with these technologies, in particular CRISPR-Cas9, is required to confirm safety and efficacy.\n\nPrecision engineering may also be used to insert genes at selected genomic locations to achieve regulated transgene expression. Thus, CARs expressed from the *TRAC* locus, which encodes the T cell receptor alpha chain, are expressed at an optimal level that is sufficient for effective expression but minimizes tonic signaling and premature T cell exhaustion [[102](#R102)]. *TRAC* targeting, which simultaneously ablates endogenous TCR expression, has since been adopted by many groups developing allogeneic approaches, while we pursue this approach to demonstrate that the generation of optimally engineered CAR T cells will reduce T cell dosing and toxicities in the autologous setting. We are also actively searching for genomic safe harbors [[143](#R143)] to engineer CARs and other transgenes to reliably regulate expression of cytokines, chemokines, secreted scFv’s, bites and other molecules in CAR T cells.\n\n## Novel cell types and technologies using CAR therapy\n\n### Virus-specific T cells (VST), natural killer (NK), invariant NKT cells.\n\nOne of the major evolutions of CAR therapy is the diversification of cell source [[132](#R132)] ([Figure 2C](#F2)). CAR constructs were initially investigated in conventional αβ-T cells, but are now investigated using other cell types including virus-specific T cells (VST), natural killer (NK), invariant NKT cells, γδ-T cells and myeloid cells. At first, memory cells with specificity towards human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were evaluated. EBV and CMV infections induce a CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell pools with an effector-memory phenotype. CMV T cells isolated and used for transduction in an attempt to increase T cell persistence were evaluated [[144](#R144), [145](#R145)]. CARs are also being investigated in γδ-T cells[[133](#R133), [146](#R146)], invariant NKT cells [[147](#R147)] and NK cells [[45](#R45)]. NK cells have become highly attractive for their potent effector functions and safety based on their cytokine secretion profile and lack of induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic settings [[148](#R148)]. Similar characteristics can be attributed to NKT cells. GD2 CAR NKT cells have been administered to patients with neuroblastoma[[149](#R149)]. Still, over 96% of all CAR clinical trials use conventional αβ-T cells for CAR T cells manufacturing ([Figure 2C](#F2)).\n\n### γδ T cells\n\nA small subset of peripheral blood cytotoxic T cells are the γδ-T cell. Similar to CAR T cells, they do not need antigenic presentation by MHC molecules for recognition and function. γδ-T cells function across MHC-barriers, and do not cause graft-vs-host disease. Their anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated using Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in preclinical studies and early phase CD20 CAR γδ T cells for r/r NHL ([NCT04735471](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04735471)) [[146](#R146)].\n\n### Macrophages\n\nThe ability of macrophages to infiltrate solid tumors and be reprogrammed, as well as the antitumor effects associated with a switch to the M1 phenotype, have been exploited in cancer immunotherapy and make these cells a desirable carrier for CARs. CAR macrophages (CAR-M) have been shown to reduce the tumor burden and prolonged overall survival in mice [[150](#R150)]. The potential of engineered CAR macrophages in cancer immunotherapy was recently illustrated in an *in vivo* mouse model of HER2-expressing ovarian cancer cells [[151](#R151)].\n\n### CAR T exosomes\n\nAlbeit acellular, this approach derives from cell-based approaches, aiming to enhance tumor infiltration by using exosomes that carry CARs on their surface [[152](#R152)]. CAR-containing exosomes express a high level of cytotoxic molecules and can inhibit tumor growth without CRS [[153](#R153)]. Their potential toxicity of T cell-derived exosomes remains to be investigated.\n\n## CARs beyond cancer\n\nInfectious disease still represents a major threat worldwide. Despite the availability of a range of treatment options, the incidence rates and mortality rates of some infectious diseases remain high, exemplified by the COVID19 pandemic. T cells play a key role in the control of most of these diseases, supporting the potential application of T cell-based therapeutic approaches, such as CAR-T-cell therapy. Other non-malignant diseases including colitis, systemic lupus, GVHD, autoimmune diseases, fungal diseases, cardiac fibrosis and cellular senescence may also benefit from CAR T cells [[154](#R154)].\n\n### Infectious diseases\n\nThe gp120 envelope protein expressed in HIV-infected T cells has been targeted by engineered CD4 and CD8+ T-cells [[144](#R144), [155](#R155)]. Another approach is based on HIV-specific CAR-T cells lacking CCR5 expression, which exhibited antiviral effects. This approach blocks virus propagation, and importantly, precludes integration of the virus into the host genome where it could persist in a latent state. There are still limitations such as CAR T-cell expansion, persistence, and potential off-target effects. A similar approach could be used to target other viruses including CMV, and HBV [[154](#R154)]\n\n### Transplantation and autoimmunity\n\nHLA-A2-specific CAR Tregs have been used to protect against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and skin transplant rejection in immunodeficient mice. Human HLA molecules in the context of HLA-disparate transplantation are ideal targets for CARs, as the antigen is abundant and expressed solely on the transplanted organ, thus will affect only on the grafted T cells eliminating the GVHD. Moreover, the ligation of HLA molecules by CAR Tregs is unlikely to have any negative effect on graft cell function, as these molecules have no signaling potential [[154](#R154)].\n\nTreating autoimmune diseases is another new focus of CAR therapy. Several approaches are in pre-clinical development to target different autoimmune mechanisms: 1. Targeting the soluble antibodies formed by using a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR T) to inhibit autoantibody reaction; 2. Using T regs to inhibit T cell autoreactivity, and 3. Eliminating autoreactive B cells to halt the accumulation of autoantibodies by directing the CAR T against the specific B cell [[156](#R156), [157](#R157)]. Specifically, treatment with ex vivo expanded Tregs has shown promise in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), albeit with impaired Treg accumulation and function at inflammatory sites. Tregs can be efficiently transduced to express functional, antigen- specific chimeric receptors that enable the specific suppression of effector T cells. This approach may enable future cell-based therapeutic applications in inflammatory bowel disease, as well as other inflammatory disorders [[155](#R155), [158](#R158)–[160](#R160)].\n\n### Senolytic CARs\n\nSenescence is a cellular program that leads to irreversible cell cycle arrest in response to stress. Defective immune clearance of senescent cells results in the latter’s accumulation and the establishment of a pro-inflammatory environment that contributes to a variety of pathologies associated with chronic tissue damage and aging, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and some neurodegenerative conditions [[161](#R161)]. As shown in mouse models of liver fibrosis, CAR T cells directed to cell surface markers selectively expressed on the surface of senescent cells can function as effective senolytic agents [[162](#R162)], opening a path for developing engineered immune cells to remove senescent cells and abrogate inflammation in a number of pathologies.\n\nCardiac diseases are a leading cause for mortality worldwide. Most myocardial diseases lead to cardiac fibrosis, which diminishes organ function and contributes to heart failure. In a murine model of cardiac injury induced by angiotensin II and phenylephrine, CAR T cells targeting FAP in interstitial fibroblasts have also been shown to facilitate myocardial regeneration, without adversely affecting wound healing [[163](#R163)]. Perivascular fibrosis persisted, consistent with the absence of FAP expression in perivascular fibroblasts, but without myelotoxicity. Altogether, the studies support the potential of CAR therapy to address pathologies associated with senescence, fibrosis and chronic inflammation.\n\n## Conclusions and prospects\n\nCD19 CAR T therapy has opened Pandora’s box for cell-based immunotherapy and synthetic immunology. These advances will rest on progress in receptor and circuit design, tumor immunology, genetic engineering and cell manufacturing sciences. The clinical results achieved with CD19 CAR T cells over the past 10 years have swayed the pharmaceutical industry to explore and invest in cell-based immune therapy, which no previous adoptive cell therapy had achieved. Considerable work lies ahead to develop a range of personalized therapies, which will require the identification of suitable targets, overcoming the tumor microenvironment, breaking into cold tumors, minimizing toxicities and further advancing T cell manufacturing, whether in autologous, allogeneic or *in vivo* settings. The potential of immunotherapy using CAR T cells is vast in cancer and beyond, including autoimmunity, senescence-associated pathologies and infectious diseases. While the challenges remain considerable, it seems that more applications will arise, and that the CAR T cell era is only at its beginning.\n\n## Acknowledgments:\n\nWe thank Tova Waks for her scientific review and her assistance in gathering the data for statistical analysis of CAR T clinical trials.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nConflict of interest: ZE and MS have several patents relating to CAR technologies.\n\n## References\n\n![Close](/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg)\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n## PERMALINK\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n### Similar articles\n\n### Cited by other articles\n\n### Links to NCBI Databases\n\n## Cite\n\n## Add to Collections\n\nConnect with NLM\n\n[National Library of Medicine\n  \n 8600 Rockville Pike](https://www.google.com/maps/place/8600+Rockville+Pike,+Bethesda,+MD+20894/%4038.9959508,\n            -77.101021,17z/data%3D!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c95e25765ddb%3A0x19156f88b27635b8!8m2!3d38.9959508!\n            4d-77.0988323)"

CD22 is also expressed on most B-ALL and usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase I trial testing a novel CD22-CAR in twenty-one children and adults, including 17 previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose dependent anti-leukemic activity was observed with complete remission in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CART cells/kg, including 5/5 patients with CD19dim/neg B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted escape from killing by CD22-CART cells. These results are the first to eastablish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in pre-B cell ALL, including in leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating comparable potency to CD19-CART at biologically active doses in B-ALL. They also highlight the critical role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function.

Blinatumomab, a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody, mediates impressive effects in patients with overt[8](#R8),[9](#R9) and minimal residual disease (MRD) levels of B-ALL[10](#R10). T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have also demonstrated impressive antileukemic effects in children and adults with relapsed/refractory B-ALL with remission rates ranging from 70–90%.[11](#R11)–[13](#R13) However, the likelihood of durable remission following CD19 targeted immunotherapy remains unknown. Although CD19 is expressed on essentially all cases of B-ALL at clinical presentation[14](#R14),[15](#R15), relapses with loss or diminished surface expression of CD19 are increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure.[12](#R12),[16](#R16)–[18](#R18)\n\nLike CD19, CD22 is expressed on most cases of pre-B cell ALL[14](#R14),[19](#R19),[20](#R20), and normal tissue expression is restricted to the B cell lineage. Substantial clinical experience and success has been reported with monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics targeting CD22.[21](#R21)–[29](#R29) We report the first clinical experience using a CD22-CAR in pre-B ALL[19](#R19),[30](#R30). Our data demonstrate that CD22-CAR expressing T cells have a similar safety profile to CD19-CARs and mediate similarly potent anti-leukemic effects, in both immunotherapy-naïve patients and patients with CD19 dim/negative relapse following CD19-directed immunotherapy. These results are the first to establish that CAR expressing T cells targeting antigens other than CD19 can mediate similarly potent antineoplastic effects and the first to demonstrate that resistance to immunotherapy via antigen loss can be overcome by treatment with CAR T cells targeting an alternative antigen, opening the way to dual targeted immunotherapeutics.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Patient Characteristics\n\nThe first twenty-one consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with CD22 CAR T cells are included in this analysis. The median age was 19 years (range 7–30 years), and all patients had undergone at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 2 patients had received 2 prior HSCTs ([Supplementary Table 1](#SD1)). Seventeen patients had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 15 who received prior CD19-CAR therapy. Lymphoblasts were CD19-negative or dim in 10 patients, including 9 following CD19-CAR therapy and 1 following blinatumomab. Median marrow blast percentage was 70.5% (range 1%-99%) and all were CNS1 (< 5 WBC/mcL and no blasts). Median CD22 site density was 2839 molecules per cell (range 613–13452). Fourteen patients manifested B-cell aplasia at enrollment (B cell counts < 50 cells/mcL), including 7 patients who had received prior therapy with a CD19-CAR suggesting ongoing effects of the previous CAR therapy please clarify why this is important. You need to provide more information for the general reader.Also, please describe in more detail the design of the CAR so that readers know from the outset that it is CD22.BB.z. All treated patients received the intended protocol-specified cell dose of T cells modified to express the anti-CD22 CAR construct which is based on a binding domain previously reported[30](#R30) and modified to incorporate a 41BB endodomain which has been shown to improve persistence.[31](#R31) A schematic of the anti-CD22 CAR construct is shown in [Figure 1A](#F1). Product characteristics are shown in [Supplemental Table 2](#SD1).\n\n#### Figure 1.

Copies of integrated CD22-CAR transgene per 100 mcg of DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\n### Toxicity\n\nThe primary toxicity was cytokine release syndrome (CRS)[11](#R11)–[13](#R13) occurring in 16/21 patients, coinciding with CAR T cell expansion, and with onset after day +5 in all patients. Protocol-defined (supplemental methods) grade 1 CRS occurred in 9 patients and grade 2 CRS occurred in 7 patients. Patient #2 experienced grade 3 self-limited, non-infectious, diarrhea during CRS which resolved with supportive care, but resulted in a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the first dose level requiring a protocol-specified expansion of the first dose level to 6 patients with no further DLTs observed. Three patients received dose level 2 (1×106/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg) with no evidence of DLT. Two patients then proceeded to dose level 3 (3 × 106/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg), and patient #10 developed dose limiting grade 4 hypoxia associated with rapid disease progression requiring brief intubation with complete resolution of the hypoxia within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. A second patient was safely treated at this dose level without DLT. Based on the single DLT at dose level 3 and clinical activity associated with significant CD22-CAR T cell expansion and persistence at dose level 2, 1×106/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg was identified as the recommended phase II dose and the cohort was expanded to ten additional patients (n=13 total at dose level 2). One subject (patient #14) with a pre-enrollment history of multi-organ failure due to sepsis, died from gram negative rod sepsis developing after resolution of CRS and neutrophil count recovery to >1000 cells/mcL. Prospective neurotoxicity evaluations demonstrated no irreversible neurotoxicity or seizure. Amongst the first 16 patients with complete assessments, transient visual hallucinations (n=2), mild unresponsiveness (n=1), mild disorientation (n=1) and mild-moderate pain (n=2) were observed but returned to baseline by day 28 post-infusion. B-cell aplasia (< 50 cells/mcL) was noted in all patients achieving remission, including patients who were not previously B-cell aplastic. Grade 3–4 toxicities possibly, probably or definitely attributed to the CD22-CAR are listed in [Supplemental Table 3](#SD1).\n\n### CD22 CARs Demonstrate Robust Expansion and Anti-leukemic Activity\n\nCAR expansion, persistence and response for individual patients are summarized in [Supplemental Table 4](#SD1). As shown in [Figure 1](#F1), CD22-CAR T cells were detected in the peripheral blood of 19/21 treated patients, peaking on Day 14. Median peak expansion was 62% of circulating T cells expressing the CD22-CAR ([Figure 1B](#F1), range 1–91%), median circulating CAR T cell number was 316/mcl ([Figure 1C](#F1), range 1–3593/mcl), and median peak expansion in the first 16 patients, measured by PCR for CAR DNA sequence was 7007 copies/100ng DNA ([Figure 1D](#F1), range 15–30,500 copies/100ng DNA). On Day 28, CAR T cells remained detectable in the peripheral blood of 15/21 patients, in the bone marrow in 15/19 patients for whom bone marrow flow was performed (median 25%, range 0–78.2%) and in the cerebrospinal fluid in 12/17 patients for whom CSF analysis was performed (range 21–71.6%). CAR-T cells remained detectable in the blood of 7 of 9 patients evaluated 3 months post-infusion, in 2 of 3 patients evaluated at 6 months post-infusion, and in one patient each evaluated 9 and 18 months post-infusion who were in ongoing remission at these timepoints.\n\nTwelve patients (57%) achieved a complete remission (CR) ([Figure 2A](#F2)); 9 were MRD negative ([Supplemental Table 4](#SD1)). Response varied with administered cell dose. At the first dose level (3×105 CD22-CAR/kg) 1 of 6 patients attained a CR compared to 11 of 15 patients (73%) at doses ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CAR/kg (p<0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Among patients receiving ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CAR/kg, complete remissions occurred in 9/10 patients who had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 5/5 who enrolled with CD19dim/neg B-ALL and 1 patient who was refractory to both CD19-CAR and blinatumomab (patient #11). Thus, we saw no evidence that previous CD19-directed immunotherapy or diminished expression of CD19 impacted response to CD22-CAR T cells. [Figure 2B](#F2) illustrates response in patient #2 whose leukemia had dim CD19 expression with substantial disease burden and experienced an MRD negative complete remission following infusion of 3×105 CAR T cells/kg. Similarly, patient #15 had complete absence of surface CD19 expression and high disease burden, but attained MRD negative remission with grade 1 CRS and considerable lymphocyte expansion ([Figure 2C and D](#F2)). Reponses were also seen in patients with extramedullary disease, including patient #13 who attained MRD negative marrow remission at day 28, with steady decrease in FDG-glucose uptake in lymphomatous disease, which fully resolved by 5 months post CAR infusion ([Figure 2E](#F2)).\n\n#### Figure 2.

Serial PET scans showing pre-treatment disease and evolution to full resolution in post-treatment evaluations in patient #13.\n\nAmong the 4 non-responders at dose levels 2 and 3, two (patients #10 and #18) demonstrated very high disease burden with rapid disease progression, which may have contributed to lack of response. Two additional non-responders (patients #12 and #17) expressed dim or partial CD22 on leukemic blasts at the time of enrollment, which emerged following inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22/calicheamicin conjugate,[29](#R29) administered immediately prior to enrollment on this study.\n\nSerum cytokines were measured serially during the first month in all patients ([Supplemental Figures 1 and 2](#SD1), representative images). Similar to previous reports following CD19-CAR therapy, we saw a general correlation between high leukemia burden and high peak cytokine levels, as illustrated by patient #4 and patient #9.\n\n### Relapse is Associated with Diminished CD22 Site Density Without Detectable CD22 Mutations or Changes in CD22 mRNA Level\n\nAmong the 12 patients who attained complete remission, 3 remain in ongoing complete remission at 21 mos, 9 mos, and 6 mos ([Supplemental Table 4](#SD1)). Eight patients relapsed 1.5–12 mos (median 6 months) post CD22-CAR infusion and relapse was associated with diminished CD22 expression in 7 patients ([Figure 3A](#F3)). Illustrative examples include patient #9, who enrolled with CD19 negative leukemia and experienced relapse 6 months following CD22-CAR therapy with blasts that were negative for both CD19 and CD22 ([Figure 3B](#F3)). Two patients who enrolled after receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin experienced early relapse including Patient #11, who relapsed at 1.5 mos following anti-CD22-CAR infusion with low but variable CD22 expression on leukemic blasts ([Figure 3C](#F3)) and patient #15 with CD19 negative leukemia following CD19-CAR therapy who relapsed with variable dim to negative CD22 expression 2 months following CD22-CAR infusion ([Figure 3D](#F3)), despite high-levels of circulating CD22-CAR cells ([Figure 2C](#F2)).\n\n#### Figure 3.

Patient #9 who enrolled with CD19 negative B-ALL, experienced an MRD negative remission following CD22-CAR, with subsequent relapse at 6 months demonstrating emergence of 2 leukemic populations with altered CD22 expression compared to pretreatment. C. Relapse with CD22 negative ALL following MRD negative remission in Patient #15 with pretreatment CD19 negative ALL. Last therapy prior to anti-CD22 CAR was with inotuzumab ozogamicin. At the time of relapse, 23% of T-cells in the marrow and 14.4% of T-cells in the peripheral blood were CD22 CAR positive. D. Patient #11 relapsed 1.5 mos following CD22 CAR infusion with CD22lo B-ALL. Therapy administered immediately prior to anti-CD22 CAR was inotuzumab ozogamicin\n\nRather than the persistent and complete absence of target that has been reported following CD19 directed immunotherapy due to preferential expression of CD19 splice variants in resistant leukemia lacking the targeted epitope[16](#R16), we observed a pattern of acquired resistance to CD22-CAR associated with diminished ([Figure 3](#F3)) and variable ([Supplemental Figure 3](#SD1)) CD22 site density assessed by flow cytometry as described in Methods. To determine whether diminished CD22 site density may have had a causal role in relapse in this setting by enabling escape from CD22-CAR T cells, we assessed functionality of the CD22-CAR against NALM6 derived cell lines engineered to express varying CD22 site densities reflecting the range observed in this study ([Figure 4A](#F4)). IFN-gamma ([Figure 4B](#F4)) and IL-2 ([Figure 4C](#F4)) production by CD22-CAR T cells was reduced following exposure to NALM6 expressing low CD22 density corresponding to levels observed at the time of relapse in patients following CD22-CAR therapy. Finally, although CD22 CAR T cells delay *in vivo* progression of CD22lo ALL, leukemia progression eventually ensues ([Figure 4D](#F4)). These results implicate diminished CD22 expression on B-ALL as a mechanism for relapse following CD22-CAR therapy.\n\n#### Figure 4. CD22 site density limits CD22 CAR functionality.\n\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b64/5774642/2120599153e4/nihms913214f4.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5774642_nihms913214f4.jpg)\n\n![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b64/5774642/2120599153e4/nihms913214f4.jpg)\n\nA.

Representative of 3 independent experiments.\n\nTo identify possible genetic or transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the observed alteration in CD22 site density, longitudinal assessment of the CD22 genomic locus and corresponding mRNA was evaluated in two patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR with diminished CD22 site density. Genome-wide copy number profiles of the leukemias remained stable despite substantial changes in CD22 site density. Heterozygosity of the CD22 locus was maintained and no focal copy number changes were observed. Mutation analysis comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples demonstrated no aquired mutations within the CD22 locus ([Figure 5A](#F5), [Supplemental Figure 4A](#SD1)). Corresponding analysis of CD22 mRNA levels pre- and post-CD22 CAR treatment demonstrated no qualitative change in the observed CD22 transcripts, and no evidence for diminished transcription of CD22, since in each case, total CD22 mRNA levels were slightly increased at the time that CD22 site density was diminished ([Figure 5B](#F5), [Supplemental Figure 4B](#SD1)). We saw no evidence for alternative CD22 isoforms as a cause of the downmodulation of CD22 expression observed although a novel isoform cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, we studied a patient derived xenograft model in mice subjected to pressure with CD22-CAR T cells which induced complete loss of CD22 surface expression. Remarkably, such leukemias again showed no evidence for genetic mutation, changes in gene copy number or isoform expression and no evidence for diminished mRNA expression ([Figure 5D and E](#F5)). Together, the data implicate post-transcriptional effects in modulating CD22 protein levels rather genomic mutation, modulation of gene expression or altered isoform expression.\n\n#### Figure 5.

The results presented here credential a novel CAR-based therapeutic for the treatment of B-ALL, but also illustrate the challenges associated with sequential administration of CD19 CAR followed by CD22 CAR therapy. We therefore sought to develop a multi-specific CAR T cell which could simultaneously recognize CD19 or CD22 expressing targets. Using a single CAR construct that incorporates both CD19 and CD22 scFv sequences into one bivalent receptor ([Figure 6A](#F6)), we demonstrate *in vitro* cytokine production against and killing of CD19+/CD22+, CD19+/CD22−, and CD22−CD19+ cell B-ALL cell lines ([Figures 6B and C](#F6), [Supplemental Figure 5](#SD1)). T cells transduced with this mutispecific construct administered intravenously at a dose 3 × 106 into NSG mice 3 days after injection of luciferase-expressing B-ALL demonstrate the ability to clear B-ALL ([Figure 6D](#F6)). Thus, the binding domain in the CD22 CAR validated in the clinical trial reported here can be combined with a CD19 binding domain validated as a CAR construct in multiple clinical trials to generate a single multitarget CAR with the potential to overcome leukemic resitance to either CAR administered alone.\n\n#### Figure 6.

Eradication of NALM6 in NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice (as described in Methods) by CAR expressing T cells as indicated and is representative of 4 independent experiments.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nCD22, a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (SIGLEC), expressed exclusively within the B cell lineage, is expressed on the vast majority of B cell malignancies, including B-ALL, indolent and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia.[14](#R14),[19](#R19),[20](#R20),[32](#R32),[33](#R33) Numerous CD22 directed therapeutics have been studied in clinical trials. Epratuzumab, an unconjugated anti-CD22 mAb, mediated modest clinical activity in adult and pediatric ALL.[21](#R21),[26](#R26),[27](#R27) CD22-immunotoxins mediated clinical activity in hairy cell leukemia[23](#R23) and B-ALL[22](#R22), but benefits were transient due to the agent’s short half-life, and substantial immunogenicity. A recent phase 3 trial of inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 mAb conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin, demonstrated complete responses in 80.7% of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.[29](#R29) However, liver toxicity limited the dose intensity that could be safely delivered and the agent is associated with higher rates of veno-occlusive disease following subsequent HSCT.[24](#R24),[34](#R34)\n\nWe generated a novel CAR targeting CD22, which we optimized by comparing potency across multiple scFvs and multiple costimulatory domains.[19](#R19),[30](#R30),[35](#R35) Therapeutics incorporating the m971 binding domain[30](#R30) have not been tested previously in clinical trials. The data presented here demonstrate no evidence for off-target toxicity, modest cytokine release syndrome and potent anti-leukemic activity following CD22-CAR therapy. Doses ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CAR cells/kg mediated substantial anti-leukemic activity, comparable to results with CD19-CAR, with 11/15 patients rendered into complete remission, including 8/10 patients previously treated with CD19 based immunotherapies, and 5/5 patients who enrolled with CD19 neg/dim relapse. Notably, all patients enrolled had undergone previous HSCT and patient #7 who had undergone two previous HSCTs prior to receiving CD22 CAR T-cells, remains in remission 21 months following CD22-CAR therapy with persistent CAR T cells and has received no additional anti-leukemic therapy since treatment with CD22-CAR T cells. Together, the data provides no evidence to suggest that previous chemotherapy or CD19-based immunotherapy diminishes the likelihood of remission induction following bioactive doses of CD22-CAR T cells. The CD22-CAR studied here incorporates a 4-1BB costimulatory endodomain, and the cells demonstrate a pattern of expansion and persistence that is similar to that observed following CD19-CAR T cells incorporating a 4-1BB endodomain, consistent with previous evidence that CAR costimulatory domains play a dominant role in modulating the rate of expansion and the likelihood of persistence following CAR therapy.[35](#R35) CD22-CAR cells also migrated efficiently to the CSF, but we observed no evidence for severe neurologic toxicity or seizures, which have been observed in studies of CD19-CAR therapy.[11](#R11)–[13](#R13)\n\nCARs targeting CD19 have demonstrated remarkable activity in B-ALL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and we demonstrate similar complete response rates in B-ALL with the CD22-CAR tested here. This is notable since numerous non-CD19 targeted CARs have entered clinical trials for B cell malignancies, (CD20-CAR[36](#R36), κ-CAR[37](#R37), CD138-CAR[38](#R38), BCMA-CAR[39](#R39)), AML[40](#R40) and solid tumors, yet none of these have demonstrated complete responses rates of >50%. This work therefore provides the first evidence that CD19 is not a uniquely effective CAR T cell target and raise the prospect that similarly effective CARs could ultimately be developed for an array of antigenic targets. Future studies are needed to determine whether the high rates observed with CD22-CARs in B-ALL will translate into similarly significant response rates in DLBCL, where CD22 expression is common.\n\nCD19 is universally expressed at high levels on B-ALL at the time of diagnosis and is retained following cytotoxic therapy.[41](#R41)–[43](#R43) However, since the introduction of CD19-based immunotherapies, relapse with diminished or absent surface CD19 has been increasingly observed and has emerged as the dominant mechanism of resistance to this class of therapeutics. CD19 immune escape was first reported following blinatumumab therapy[10](#R10), but has now been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy.[12](#R12),[44](#R44) In a recent report of 50 patients rendered into remission with CD19-CAR therapy, with a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 40% of patients had relapsed, and loss of the CD19 target accounted for 65% of the total relapses.[17](#R17) Thus, while the true incidence is unknown, CD19 immune escape is emerging as the most common cause of relapse following CD19-CAR therapy for B-ALL. Recent investigation into the biology of “CD19 negative B-ALL” has revealed that the majority of cases retain mRNA specific for CD19, but are enriched for CD19 isoforms that preferentially remain intracellular and/or lack the epitopes targeted by all CD19-CARs currently under study as well as blinatumumab.[16](#R16) An alternative pathway for loss or diminished CD19 expression involves lineage switch of blasts with acquisition of myeloid markers and characteristics.[45](#R45) None of the patients enrolled on this study appeared to manifest CD19 loss associated with lineage switch.\n\nThe data presented here demonstrate that diminished CD22 site density, rather than total loss of expression, is sufficient to permit escape of leukemia from CD22-directed CAR therapy. This is not unique to the CD22-CAR, but rather reflects a pattern observed across chimeric antigen receptors, which demonstrate a higher requirement for antigen induced activation than is seen for native T cell receptors[46](#R46)–[49](#R49). Decrease in CD22 site density or complete CD22 loss were observed in 7/8 patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR induced remission. Given that CD22 expression is often variable at presentation, it appears likely that this phenomena represents selection of pre-existing CD22lo cells within the heterogeneous leukemia population. Notably, we identified no genetic basis for the change in expression level and no evidence for diminished mRNA levels in leukemic cells demonstrating low CD22 site density, thus implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms in this biology. Regardless of the mechanism, decades of experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy for B-ALL have convincingly established that multimodal chemotherapy is required to achieve long-term remission. Based on clear evidence for CD19 antigen loss or downregulation following CD19-directed immunotherapy, and evidence for diminished CD22 expression contributing to relapse following sequential CAR therapy, we propose that simultaneous immunotherapeutic targeting of multiple antigens may diminish the likelihood of antigen loss escape. Proof-of-principle for bioactivity of a multispecific CD19/CD22-CAR in mice is demonstrated here.\n\nThe majority of patients who develop CD19 immune escape following CD19 directed immunotherapy retain CD22 expression and this report demonstrates that such leukemias retain susceptible to immune-based targeting. Furthermore, while we demonstrate proof-of principle that sequential immunotherapeutic targeting of a second antigen can mediate clinical benefit, we also observe a high rate of relapse associated with diminution in CD22 expression using this approach, raising the prospect that simultaneous multispecific targeting may be a more effective approach to enhance the durability of immunotherapy-induced remissions in B-ALL. Toward this end, we have developed a chimeric antigen receptor that simultaneously targets both CD19 and CD22, which could prove more effective at inducing remissions and be less susceptible to relapse associated with antigen escape[50](#R50). Clinical trials testing this CD19/CD22 mutispecific target CAR are underway.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Trial Design and Toxicity Monitoring\n\nThis Phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation trial conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute was designed to test the safety and feasibility of CD22-CAR T cell therapy in children and young adults, aged 1–30 years, with relapsed or refractory CD22 expressing hematopoietic malignancies which had not responded to or had recurred following standard regimens. The protocol was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board and the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ([NCT02315612](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02315612)). All authors reviewed, discussed and interpreted the study results and vouch for the data and analyses. Written informed consent for participation was obtained from patients or the parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.. This report represents an interim analysis from the first, consecutively treated 21 patients with pre-B ALL who received CD22-CAR T cell infusions between December 2014 and August 2016 with a data cut-off of June 1, 2017. A total of 23 subjects were enrolled, but in one case T lymphocyte numbers were inadequate for CAR cell production and thus this patient was not treated on study; in a second case the diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which is not included in this analysis of efficacy in B-ALL.\n\nA standard 3 + 3 Phase I dose escalation design was used. If 2/6 patients experienced a DLT at dose level 1, safety would have been evaluated in a de-escalated dose of 1 × 105 transduced T cells/kg. Once the maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) was reached, enrollment into an expansion cohort of a total of 12 patients in two strata proceeded to provide additional information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment. In the expansion cohort, patients who have previously received CD19-CAR T cells will be evaluated as a separate stratum from CAR-naïve patients. All doses allowed a range of ± 20% of the prescribed dose to allow for potential variations in the cell products.\n\nDose limiting toxicity was defined as any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity attributed as possibly, probably, or likely related to either the lymphodepletion regimen or the CD22-CAR T cells with exception of low electrolyte levels responding to supplementation, tumor lysis syndrome, hypoalbuminemia, liver dysfunction resolved to < grade 2 within 14 days, transient (< 72 hours) grade 4 hepatic enzyme abnormality, pre-existing coagulopathy, grade 3 or 4 fever lasting 7 days or less, grade 3 diarrhea that resolves to grade 2 within 4 days, grade 3 nausea and/or anorexia and any infusion related toxicity occurring within 24 hours that would resolve with minimal intervention. and grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Cytokine release syndrome was graded and managed based on Lee et al.[51](#R51) Additionally, subjects with abnormal blood counts at baseline due to marrow involvement were not evaluable for hematologic toxicity.\n\nTo evaluate possible neurotoxic effects, psychologists administered a brief (<1 hour) neurocognitive battery to patients prior to (baseline) and 1-month after (day 21–28) CD22 CAR T cell infusion. The test battery consisted of the NIH Toolbox computerized test[1](#R1) evaluating attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and a paper/pencil test assessing processing speed[2](#R2). At baseline and then at approximately 14 and 21 days post-infusion, the caregiver of the patient or the adult patient completed a neuro-symptom checklist that assessed fever, auditory or visual hallucinations, responsiveness to commands, disorientation, depressed mood, and pain.[52](#R52)\n\n### Eligibility\n\nPatients were eligible if their disease had recurred after standard upfront therapy and at least one salvage therapy. There was no limit on the number of previous salvage therapies the patient may have received. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant was allowed if at least 100 days had elapsed since transplant, there was no evidence of GVHD and the patient was off systemic immunosuppression for at least 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients who had received prior CD19-CAR therapy were eligible if at least 30 days had elapsed since CD19-CAR infusion and circulating levels of genetically modified cells were <5% by flow cytometry.\n\nEligibility required a performance status of ≥ 50% by Karnofksy for patients > 16 years of age, or ≥ 50% using the Lansky scale for patients < 16 years of age. Minimal weight for eligibility was 15 kg. Patients with asymptomatic CNS1 or CNS2 leukemia were eligible, whereas patients with symptomatic or CNS3 leukemia were ineligible, as previously described.[12](#R12) Patients with isolated CNS or testicular leukemia were not eligible.\n\nPatients with uncontrolled intercurrent infection, other malignancies, illnesses or conditions that would limit their ability to tolerate or comply with the study requirements were ineligible. Patients were also ineligible if they demonstrated seropositivity for HIV or HCV or positive testing for HBV surface antigen or if they had a history of hypersensitivity to agents required for the treatment regimen. Other exclusion criteria included inadequate liver function defined as total bilirubin > 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with documented Gilbert’s) or transaminase levels > 3× ULN; renal function < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or hyperleukocytosis (≥50,000 circulating blasts/uL).\n\nSystemic chemotherapy must have been completed > 2 weeks prior to enrollment (> 6 weeks for clofarabine or nitrosureas), radiation therapy must have been completed > 3 weeks prior to enrollment, monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy must have been completed at least 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to enrollment and investigational anti-neoplastic therapy must have been completed at least 30 days prior to enrollment. No washout period was required for intrathecal chemotherapy, hydroxyurea (provided no increase in dose within 2 weeks prior to enrollment), standard maintenance ALL therapy or physiologic steroid replacement.\n\n### CD22 CAR Construct and Manufacturing of CD22-CAR T cells\n\nThe CD22-CAR contains a fully human single chain fragment variable region generated from a human B cell phage library[30](#R30), a CD8 transmembrane domain and CD3 zeta plus 4-1BB signaling chains (CD22.BB.z) as previously described and as illustrated in [Figure 1A](#F1).[19](#R19),[35](#R35) All patients received the identical preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d on Days −4, −3, −2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on day −2, with CD22-CAR T cell infusion on Day 0. Additional details can be found in the [Supplementary Methods](#SD1).\n\nCD22-CAR T cells were produced in the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH Clinical Center. This laboratory operates under principles of Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice with established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or protocols for sample receipt, processing, freezing, and analysis. All patients underwent leukapheresis within 5 days following enrollment. Leukapheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cells were either placed directly into culture or cryopreserved prior to culture initiation on a subsequent day. In cases where substantial numbers of myeloid cells were present in the apheresis products, elutriation and/or plastic adherence[53](#R53) was performed based on evidence that such cells inhibited expansion[54](#R54). The lentiviral vector containing CD22.BB.Z-CAR, was produced by Lentigen Inc. Cells were expanded in sterile bags in a 37oC incubator for 9 days, with an additional 3 days of culture permitted to allow resolution of intercurrent clinical events. If > 3 days was required, cells were cryopreserved then thawed immediately prior to infusion. Final product release criteria required the following: cell viability ≥ 70%, cell number within 20% of planned dose, % CAR T cells ≥ 15% as measured using CD22-Fc fusion protein, endotoxin ≤ 5 EU/mL, Mycoplasma negative, gram stain and culture negative, VSV-G DNA (as a surrogate marker for replication competent lentivirus (RCL)) negative by qPCR. In process culture-based testing was also performed on an aliquot of the product at the National Gene Vector Laboratory (Indiana University) using assays for p24 antigen and product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay (PERT) to complete testing for RCL.\n\n### Response Monitoring\n\nBaseline bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed within 14 days prior to beginning the lymphodepletion preparative regimen, and then response was monitored via bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture performed on Day 28 ± 4 days from cell infusion, and at months 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Complete remission (CR) was defined by morphologic assessment of the bone marrow as M1 (<5% leukemic blasts) with no evidence of extramedullary disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry conducted at the NCI Laboratory of Pathology using standard techniques.\n\n### Cytokine Assays, PCR and Flow cytometry\n\nPlasma was cryopreserved before measurement of cytokines in a multiplex format according to manufacturer's instructions (MesoScaleDiscovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). CD22-CAR T cell expansion was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and adapted from published methods[55](#R55). Briefly, measured CAR copies per 100 ng DNA were normalised to the input quantity of amplifiable DNA by measurement of the single-copy gene, *CDKN1a*.\n\nSpecimens for flow cytometry were processed within 12 h of collection and stained with a panel of antibodies to quantitate leukemic burden and measure CAR T cells numbers. Briefly whole blood lysis was performed using ammonium chloride prior to staining for 30 minutes at room temperature with the following two cocktails (antibody concentration according to manufacturer’s recommendations): Cocktail A- CD16FITC (clone DJ130c, Dako), CD19PE (clone SJ25C1), CD3PerCP (clone SK7, BD), CD13PECy7 (L138, BD), CD34APC (clone 8G12, BD), CD14 APC H7 (MP9, BD), CD56v450 (clone B159, BD), CD45 v500 (clone HI30, BD); and Cocktail B-CD66bFITC (clone G10F5, BD), CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 (clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), CD24APC (clone SN3 A5-2H10, eBioscience), CD45 APC H7 (clone 2D1, BD), CD10BV421 (cloneHI10a, BD) and CD38BV510 (clone HB-7, Biolegend). At least 1 million cells were acquired per tube using an 8-color multiparametric approach on a 3-laser FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with DiVa 6.1.1 software and analyzed by FCS Express 4 software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA). The validated limit of detection of leukemic blasts with this assay is 0.002% of cells.\n\nCD22-CAR T cells were measured using a CD22-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis of estimated blood volume and measured absolute lymphocyte counts. CAR T-cells were detected using the following cocktail: CD20FITC (B-Ly1, Dako), CD10PE (cloneHI10a, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 (clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), CD22-Fc-APC (R&D Systems), CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), CD14 v450 (Mtems), CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), , CD10PE s instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).E content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis of estimated blood volume and measured absolute lymphocyte counts.\n\n### CD19 and CD22 Flow Cytometric Site Density Determination\n\nCD22 and CD19 site density on blasts was enumerated by flow cytometry according to manufacturer's instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The antibody bound per cell (ABC) was determined as previously described[56](#R56),[57](#R57) for anti-CD19PE (clone SJ25C1) and anti-CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on leukemic blasts using saturating concentrations of antibody and the BD Biosciences QuantiBRITE system (QuantiBRITE standard beads and QuantiCALC software) for fluorescence quantitation. The ABC value represents the mean value of the maximum capacity of each cell to bind the antibody. QuantiBRITE PE beads are pre-calibrated standard beads containing known numbers of PE molecules bound per bead. QuantiBRITE beads were acquired on a FACSCanto™II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on the same day at the same instrument settings as the individual patient specimens. A standard curve comparing the geometric mean of fluorescence to known PE content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. The regression analysis, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were determined. By gating based upon immunophenotype, blasts were distinguished from normal cells and the geometric mean fluorescence of CD19 and CD22 staining was reported for each population. The ABC values were generated from the measured geometric mean fluorescence of the gated cells using the QuantiBRITE standard curve. ABC values were only determined for populations containing 100 or greater events to achieve adequate precision. The geometric mean fluorescence of T- and NK-cells stained with the B-cell antibodies (negative control) has been previously determined and the negative ABC range is used to confirm positivity versus negativity. In addition, blasts with anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 staining less than or equal to T-cells (internal negative control) are considered negative.\n\n### CRISPR/Cas9 Editing of cell lines\n\nGuide-RNAs were designed from the GeCKO human sgRNAs library, cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene Plasmid 52961), and transformed into Stbl3 bacteria as previously published (hCD19F: 5’ CACCGTGGAATGTTTCGGACCTAGG 3’, hCD19R: 5’ AAACCCTAGGTCCGAAACATTCCAC 3’, hCD22F: 5’ CACCGTCTCCTTCTCGAATCGGCAT 3’, and hCD22R: 5’ AAACATGCCGATTCGAGAAGGAGAC 3’). Plasmids were co-transfected with packaging plasmids RRE, pMD-G, and REV into LentiX HEK293T cells (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). After two days, CRISPR supernatants were harvested and filtered through a 0.45µm low protein binding membrane (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), resuspended in PBS, and used immediately or stored at −80°C. For viral transduction, 1×105 leukemia cells were incubated with 10µl of concentrated viral supernatant for 2 days, followed by expansion in RPMI with 10%FBS, Pen/Strep, and Glutamax. Cell phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry, followed by sorting of cells with phenotypic alterations and single cell cloning. Sequencing was performed on single cell clones to confirm genotypic alterations by Plantinum PCR Supermix High Fidelity Kit (Invitrogen) (hCD19F Seq: 5’ TCTCCCTCTCCTGGGTG 3’, hCD19R Seq: 5’ CTCTCCCTCCCAGATCTCAG 3’, hCD22F Seq: 5’ AGGAGGGAAGGGGTACTG 3’, and hCD22R Seq: 5’ AGCCAACGTTTTGGATCTTCAG 3’). To obtain cell lines with various CD22 site densities, a complete sequence of cDNA human CD22 plasmid (Origene) was re-transduced into the CD22-negative cell line at different concentrations. Cell lines were single-cell cloned with resultant cell lines including CD22-negative (CD22neg), CD19-negative (CD19neg), CD2-low site density (CD22lo), and CD22-high site density (CD22hi) cell lines. QuantiBRITE Beads (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used, as per above description to identify site density of CRISPR/Cas9-modified cell lines.\n\n### CD19xCD22 Bispecific CAR\n\nA Bispecific CAR construct was developed using a CD19 binding domain derived from a clinically active CD19 CAR[12](#R12) and a CD22 binding domain used for the CD22 CAR reported herein. A schematic of the CD19xCD22 bispecific CAR is shown in [Figure 4A](#F4) and the full sequence is provided [Supplemental Figure 6](#SD1).\n\nThe bispecific CAR was transduced onto human T cells using lentiviral vectors. The potency of the bispecific CAR was tested against the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out cell lines as well as parental Nalm6 ALL cell line. Cytokine production was analyzed in cell co-culture supernatants using R&D ELISA Kit for Interferon-gamma and IL-2, following the product protocol (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). In brief, CD22 CAR T cells were washed three times and co-incubated with varying tumor target cells at 1:1 effector-to-target ratio for 16–20 hours. Supernatant was collected from co-incubation and used for evaluation of cytokine production. Of note, supernatant was diluted 1:10 in media for Interferon-gamma analysis. Supernatant was not diluted for IL-2 evaluation. Optical density was determined within 30 minutes, using a microplate reader set to 450nm with wavelength correction of 540nm. *In vitro* killing was analyzed using an Incucyte assay (Essen bioscience). CAR cells were co-incubated with GFP-positive tumor target cells at a range of effector-to-target ratio. At the 24-hour time-point, Green Fluorescent Units per well (GFU/well) was calculated using Incucyte software, standardized to baseline GFU/well and normalized to tumor only wells. Assays were performed in triplicate and data is representative of multiple repeat experiments.\n\n### Xenograft Models\n\n*In vivo* analysis of CAR activity was conducted using a xenograft model with NOD.Cg-*Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl*/SzJ (NSG, Jackson Laboratories) mice. Mice were injected intravenously with 1×106 GFP-positive Nalm6 tumor cells on Day 0. On Day CAR-transduced T cells or Mock-transduced T cells were injected as indicated. Mice were imaged using IVIS technology and luciferin-D IP injections. All animal studies were approved by National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n### Genomic Profiling\n\nAll primary patient samples were collected on IRB approved protocols for biological specimen research. Leukemia samples from bone marrow specimens containing greater than 90% leukemia were isolated by density gradient separation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Lonzo). The cells were lysed and nucleic acid extraction was performed using Qiagen Allprep Kits (Qiagen) per the manufactures protocol. DNA and RNA were quantified and assessed for quality using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Poly-adenylated RNA libraries were generated and sequenced using TruSeq 4.0 chemistry on a Hiseq2500 (Illumina). Whole exome data was generated using Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5 and TruSeq V4 chemistry and sequenced to a median of 300× coverage using on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina).\n\nWhole exome and RNA-sequencing data was analyzed and mapped using the CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR) pipeline (<https://bioinformatics.cancer.gov/>). Reads were aligned to reference genome Hg19. Somatic variant calling was performed using MuTect[58](#R58) and copy number alterations were analyzed using Nexus Copy Number Discovery Edition #9. (BioDiscovery). The integrity of the CD22 gene was interrogated by manual inspection using Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV). RNAsequencing reads for each sample were trimmed of their adapters and low quality bases using Trimmomatic software and aligned with reference human Hg38 and Gencode V24 transcripts using STAR software. Expression of CD22 transcript was evaluated using a log2 of the RPKM of RNAseq data.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nDoses of anti-CD22-CAR transduced T-cells were administered in a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design until MTD was determined. After treatment of the first patient in the first cohort there was a four-week (28 day) safety assessment prior to treatment of the second patient. Subsequent patients in a cohort were treated after a one-week safety assessment period following cell infusion. Patients were enrolled sequentially; therefore, enrollment did not proceed to a higher dose level until all patients had been treated in the prior cohort and the last patient treated on the completed cohort had been observed for at least 4 weeks. If a minimum of 1 ×105 anti-CD22-CAR-transduced T cells per kg cannot be obtained for infusion, the patient may be treated but would not be evaluable for toxicity or response, but would be considered a feasibility failure. Up to 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in cohorts 1 to 4 (24 total in order to determine MTD. In addition, the study will allow for up to 3 patients to be replaced in each of the dose cohorts 1 through 3 (9 additional patients) due to inability to achieve target doses. In addition, the study will allow for 6 total in-evaluable patients (patients enrolled but who cannot receive cells, either due to physical deterioration or withdrawn consent during cell growth).\n\n### Data Availability\n\nPatient-related data not included in the manuscript may be restricted as it was generated in the context of an ongoing clinical trial and may be subject to patient confidentiality.

Anti-CD4 CAR-T cells are potential targets showing promising results against T-cell lymphoma (CD4 positive) models in vivo and in vitro (Pinz et al., 2016). Clinical trials evaluating multitargeted CAR-T cell therapy against ALL, such as single engineered CAR-T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 and a combination of CAR-T cells with anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 to target each antigen independently, have yielded encouraging results (Huang et al., 2018).

Several strategies have been identified for cancer treatment and evaluated for their efficacy against other diseases such as autoimmune and infectious diseases. One of the most advanced technologies is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, a pioneering therapy in the oncology field. Successful clinical trials have resulted in the approval of six CAR-T cell products by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, there have been various obstacles that limit the use of CAR T-cell therapy as the first line of defense mechanism against cancer. Various innovative CAR-T cell therapeutic designs have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical trial settings and have demonstrated much potential for development. Such trials testing the suitability of CARs against solid tumors and HIV are showing promising results. In addition, new solutions have been proposed to overcome the limitations of this therapy. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding this novel technology, including CAR T-cell structure, different applications, limitations, and proposed solutions.\n\n**Keywords:** chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, adaptive immunity, autoimmune disorder, cancer immunotherapy, solid tumor, tumor infiltration\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe global cancer burden, cancer incidence, and mortality estimations have increased rapidly. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 19.3 million diagnosed cases and 10.0 million deaths worldwide in 2020 have been attributed to cancer ([Sung et al., 2021](#B282)). The relationship between cancer and the immune system was shown by Rudolf Virchow more than 150 years ago ([Adams et al., 2015](#B4)). Interest in immune system activation as a therapeutic approach for treating cancer began in the late 19th century when William Coley injected heat-inactivated bacteria into the tumor mass, resulting in its size reduction. Although the failure to achieve desirable clinical outcomes with early immunotherapies such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-2 treatments, novel immunotherapies launched in the 21st century have achieved robust clinical results, establishing cancer immunotherapy as one of the foremost anchors of anticancer therapies ([Lesterhuis et al., 2011](#B164); [Jiang T. et al., 2016](#B128); [Castro et al., 2018](#B38)).\n\nThe effective eradication of cancer cells via the immune system involves several steps known as the cancer-immunity cycle, defined as a series of steps involving increased antitumor T-cell responses that are initiated upon recognition of the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) captured from dying tumor cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs). Upon capturing TAA’s, DCs get activated, express CCR7, mature, and 1) migrate to draining lymph nodes, 2) present the captured antigens to naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, 3) express T-cell costimulatory molecules, for example, CD40, CD80, and CD86, 4) secrete critical cytokines to regulate T-cell responses, 5) activate naïve CD8+ T-cells converting them into cytotoxic T-cells, which immigrate from lymphoid organs into the bloodstream and reach tissues and ultimately infiltrate the tumor. Activated cytotoxic T cells recognize the specific TAA (presented to them by DC’s) found on MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules of tumor cells and kill the tumor cells via secreting perforins and granzymes that result in the release of additional TAAs, which trigger the initiation of another cycle of cancer immunity ([Chen and Mellman, 2013](#B44)).\n\nCancer eradication through cytotoxic immune responses is evident; however, cancers can grow progressively, suggesting their ability to mask and not be recognized by the immune system as seen in carcinogen-induced mouse models. This mechanism prompted Schreiber and others to hypothesize the immunoediting concept to explain the progressive growth of otherwise immunogenic cancers ([Shankaran et al., 2001](#B262); [Dunn et al., 2004](#B69); [Schreiber et al., 2011](#B255); [Matsushita et al., 2012](#B195)). The immunoediting process of human cancers can be related to neoepitope presentation. Non-silent point mutations that lead to antigenic neoepitopes (T-cell recognition) are lost more frequently in cancers than in silent point mutations, thus preventing T-cells from recognizing and identifying cancer cells ([Rooney et al., 2015](#B244)). This concept suggests that the ability of cancers to progress and grow could be impaired by loss of immunogenicity; however, this perception alone contradicts another evidence that T-cells are adequately activated to enhance their cancer recognition by the administration of immune-activating cytokines or immune checkpoints releases such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) that leads to robust tumor responses in patients and mice ([Chambers et al., 2001](#B40); [Pardoll, 2012](#B222)). T cells are central infiltrates of the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME), and their population consists of naïve, effector, memory, and regulatory T cells ([Hashimoto et al., 2018](#B105)). The antigen stimulation of T cell receptors (TCRs) initiates an intrinsic program that guides the differentiation of T cells into cytotoxic effectors capable of eradicating the antigen; however, these cells start dying gradually except for a small number of surviving memory T cells that provide long-term protection against the antigen ([Chang et al., 2014](#B41)). Chronic exposure of T cells to the same antigen leads to remarkable alterations, thus affecting their activation and differentiation and eventually causing T-cell exhaustion ([Wherry, 2011](#B322); [Schietinger and Greenberg, 2014](#B254)). T effector cell exhaustion is highlighted by the loss of effector functions such as proliferation, cytotoxicity, metabolic and transcriptional molecule alterations, and immune checkpoint upregulation ([Guo et al., 2018](#B98); [Li H. et al., 2019](#B167)). Different factors have been identified that play several roles in T-cell exhaustion; the intrinsic factors relate to transcription, epigenetic, and metabolic factors, whereas the extrinsic factors include extracellular and cytokine interactions that create the TME and the immunosuppressive network ([Maimela et al., 2019](#B186); [Zhang et al., 2020](#B349)). Therefore, the use of engineered T-cells targeting specific cell-surface antigens is considered a great approach to ensure specificity and overcome the shortcomings of other available immunotherapies.\n\nIn this review, we present a comprehensive prospect of the developmental and experimental progress in the field of chimeric antigen receptor **(**CAR) T-cell therapy while relating to some aspects of adaptive immunity as the rationale behind the evolution of this cutting-edge technology. The significance of this review is the broad inclusiveness of current therapeutic applications of CAR T-cells in hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection while focusing on some recently published results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, pointing out some drawbacks, and suggesting some modifications.\n\n## 2 Adoptive Immune Therapy\n\nCancer immune therapy, which exploits the body’s immune system to combat cancer cells, can be classified into three categories: adoptive cell therapies (ACTs), tumor vaccines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These therapies have proven beneficial in patients with advanced tumors, and some have reached complete remission ([Li D. et al., 2019](#B166)). ACT is mainly based on the concept that the immune system can control a patient’s cancer in the long-term and has been demonstrated by three independent approaches. The first approach involved tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which can be isolated from tumor lesions (e.g., melanoma) and expanded *in vitro*, followed by patient re-infusion, resulting in tumor regression and remission in a considerable number of patients. However, the downsides of the TILs approach included access limitations to the removable metastases or tumors, time-consuming preparation of T cells, and tumor-reactive T-cell clones were rarely found, which hindered the success of this strategy. The second approach involved T-cell receptor (TCR) engineering, where TCRs identified from TILs were virally transduced into peripheral blood T-cells, making them capable of inducing tumor regressions upon re-infusion into the patient. Unfortunately, this method was explicitly restricted because of its dependency on identifying MHC peptides expressed by tumors via their MHC complexes ([Dudley et al., 2002](#B68); [Zacharakis et al., 2018](#B343); [Benmebarek et al., 2019](#B19)). The third ACT approach is CAR-engineered T cells and is marked as the beginning of a new era in cancer therapy by providing a transformative approach to tumor exclusion and gained attention over the other two as it offered a series of innovative modifications ([Kershaw et al., 2006](#B140); [Lamers et al., 2011](#B161); [Mikkilineni and Kochenderfer, 2017](#B200)). CARs are synthetic receptors that have the specificity of a monoclonal antibody and a signaling domain capable of inducing a cascade of events in the CAR-engineered immune cells (e.g., T-lymphocytes) upon target engagement. Engineering immune cells to express CARs is achieved by transferring protein-coding sequences using viral vectors (e.g., Lentiviral or Retroviral). CAR T-cells display immunological characteristics similar to activated T cells such as generating an immune response against target cells and expanding within the patient ensuring long-term protection ([Porter et al., 2011](#B230); [Grupp et al., 2013](#B96); [Heiblig et al., 2015](#B110)).\n\n## 3 Evolution of CAR-T Cells\n\nConventional T cells can distinguish between foreign peptide-MHCs (pMHCs) and the body’s pMHCs via their TCRs, which can trigger a small number of agonist pMHCs compared with thousands self-pMHCs ([Sykulev et al., 1996](#B284); [Irvine et al., 2002](#B120); [Huang et al., 2013](#B117)). Genetic insertion of CARs, in immune cells, particularly T-cells, redirects them to target a preferred antigen ([Jackson et al., 2016](#B123)). CARs are bioengineered receptors which specifically target a desired antigen; almost 30 years ago, the first CARs were generated and undergone multiple modifications since they contributed to their development and evolution ([Kobold et al., 2015](#B150); [Lim and June, 2017](#B174)). The flexibility of CARs arises from their ability to recognize antigens in the absence of MHC presentation, which is the opposite of innate TCRs ([Lim and June, 2017](#B174)). Additionally, CARs have advanced properties compared with conventional T-cells, as they combine the antigen-binding ability of monoclonal antibodies with T-cell self-renewal and lytic capacity ([Ramos and Dotti, 2011](#B236); [Curran et al., 2012](#B59); [Maher, 2012](#B185)). Also, TCRs can recognize short peptide sequences, whereas CAR T-cells can recognize several tumor antigens in different forms, such as proteins, glycolipids, and carbohydrates ([Abbott et al., 2020](#B1)). CAR T-cell recognition and destruction of tumor cells occur in an independent-manner of MHCs; this promotes enhanced cell recognition undisturbed by the tumor’s ability to avoid MHC-restricted recognition of T-cells, such as the tumor’s ability to encourage defective antigen processing by downregulating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules ([Dotti et al., 2014](#B65)). It is considered an advantage where MHC expression is suppressed or lost due to the immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment ([Garrido et al., 2016](#B84)). CARs have been proven effective in treating cancers, especially hematological tumors. The specificity of CARs in targeting cancers makes them an appealing alternative to standard cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation ([Sadelain et al., 2013](#B249)). CARs consist of three major domains: 1) extracellular domain (ectodomain), which can be further divided into an antigen-recognition domain, a single peptide on the cell surface cleaved from the mature CAR cell ([Goulart et al., 2017](#B93)). The antigen-recognition domain is a single-chain fragment variant (scFV) chiefly comprising of heavy and variable light chain regions composed of an antigen-specific immunoglobin separated by a flexible linker and attached to the transmembrane domain by a spacer (hinge) responsible for the transmission of receptor-binding signals ([Zhang et al., 2017](#B346)). 2) transmembrane domain is essential for receptor stability and surface expression; it is a hydrophobic alpha helix that extends in the cell membrane ([Ramos and Dotti, 2011](#B236); [Zhang et al., 2017](#B346)). 3) intracellular domain (endo-domain), which upon stimulation, clusters and undergoes conformational changes, thus enabling the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins ([Cantrell, 2002](#B30); [Su and Vale, 2018](#B279)). The intracellular domain classifies CARs into five generations: first has a single activation domain, a cytoplasmic domain mostly CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), and some studies used the gamma chain (γ) of the Fc receptors, the second generation has CD3ζ plus one costimulatory domain, obtained from costimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB or CD28 connected to an activator domain (CD3ζ/γ chain of Fc receptor) to enhance both cell proliferative and cytotoxic competences of CAR T cells ([Finney et al., 1998](#B74); [Hombach et al., 2001](#B116); [Acuto and Michel, 2003](#B3)). The third generation is similar to the second generation but has multiple costimulatory domains with CD3ζ, such as 4-1BB and CD28, CD134, and CD137 ([Sadelain et al., 2013](#B249); [Zhang et al., 2017](#B346); [Guedan et al., 2019](#B97)). The fourth generation CARs, known as T cells redirected for universal cytokine-mediated killing (TRUCKs), were engineered to release transgenic cytokine-like interleukin 12 (IL-12) upon CAR signaling in the tumor tissue to overcome TME immunosuppression and endorse robust therapeutic outcomes ([Chmielewski et al., 2014](#B50); [Chmielewski and Abken, 2015](#B49), [2020](#B48)). IL-12 is responsible for the induction of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzymes in T-cells, and inhibits Treg proliferation ([Kubin et al., 1994](#B158); [Cao et al., 2009](#B32)). Other cytokines studied in the fourth generation are IL-15 and IL-18 ([Hurton et al., 2016](#B119)). IL-15 belongs to the γ-chain family and holds important properties for T cell expansion and survival ([Klebanoff et al., 2004](#B147)). Additionally, IL-18 CAR T-cells treatment of large pancreatic and lung tumors exhibited changes in the immune cell landscape related to the tumor; a significant increase in the macrophages (CD206− M1) and NKs (NKG2D+) was observed besides a decrease in Tregs such as M2 macrophages suppressive CD103+ DCs, suggesting the ability of “IL-18 TRUCKs” to sensitize large tumor lesions for efficient immune destruction ([Chmielewski and Abken, 2017](#B47)).The fifth generation of CARs is currently being explored; it is mainly designed based on the second generation. However, it contains a truncated cytoplasmic receptor (IL-12) and a β-chain domain (IL-2Rβ truncated intracellular interleukin 2β chain receptor) along with the transcription factor STAT3/5 binding motif ([Tokarew et al., 2019](#B296)) ([Figure 1](#F1)).\n\n### FIGURE 1.\n\n[![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/dc7915c3055b/fbioe-10-797440-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9256991_fbioe-10-797440-g001.jpg)\n\n![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/dc7915c3055b/fbioe-10-797440-g001.jpg)\n\nStructure of CARs and different generations. **(A)** Highlights the general structure of CARs; they have an extracellular domain containing scFV derived from antibody variable heavy and light chains, linker, and a hinge/spacer region. All the extracellular structures provide flexibility and improve the binding affinity of the antigen. A transmembrane domain helps anchor molecules to the T cells, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motifs, responsible for transmitting activating and costimulatory signals to T cells, is also present. **(B)** CARs have witnessed rapid advancement since the first generation, which contained only ITAM (CD3ζ) motifs as the T cell stimulatory molecule within the intracellular domain. The second generation had one costimulatory molecule, whereas the third generation had two costimulatory molecules to improve cytotoxicity and robustness of CAR-T cells. The fourth generation was designed based on the second generation but was paired with cytokine expressors (e.g., IL-12) under the control of NFAT transcription factor; therefore, this generation is referred to as T cell redirected for universal cytokine-mediated killing (TRUCKs). The fifth generation was also based on the second generation with additional intracellular domains of cytokine receptors (e.g., IL-2Rβ) to activate JAK and STAT3/5, stimulate cell proliferation, and enhance its persistence.\n\nThe structure and design of CARs contribute to their signaling mechanisms, effector functions, efficacy, and toxicity. The ligand recognition and signaling of CARs are affected by both the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and cytoplasmic domains; however, the transmembrane and spacer domains (non-signaling) affect the function of CARs ([Jayaraman et al., 2020](#B127)). Generally, CAR T-cells can specifically recognize cancer cells and lyse them ([Maggs et al., 2021](#B183)).\n\n## 4 Clinical Preparation of CAR-T Cells\n\nDespite various designs and tumor-specific scFVs, the manufacturing process of CAR-T cells remains constant ([Wang and Rivière, 2016](#B315)). In general, the personalized clinical production of CAR-T cells encompasses several steps followed by quality control testing through the entire process ([Levine, 2015](#B165)). The first step is collecting leukocytes from the patient (autologous) or the donor (allogeneic) from the peripheral blood via leukapheresis, in which only the leukocytes are extracted, and the rest of the blood products are returned to circulation ([Brown and Adusumilli, 2016](#B24); [Zhang et al., 2017](#B346)). Second, T cells are augmented, separated, and washed with leukapheresis buffer ([Zhang et al., 2017](#B346); [Gomes-Silva and Ramos, 2018](#B92)). Third, at the CD4/CD8 composition level, the T-cell subsets are separated using specific antibody-coated bead conjugates or markers. The isolated cells are then cultured and activated by purified allogeneic or autologous APCs or by introducing beads coated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (or both along with feeder cells and interleukins) ([Guedan et al., 2019](#B97)). IL-2 is the most common growth factor used to induce the rapid growth of T cells ([Wang and Rivière, 2016](#B315); [Guedan et al., 2019](#B97)). Recently, a study reported that a cytokine cocktail of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 induced better expansion of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells ([Coppola et al., 2020](#B55)).\n\nFourth, different methods have been considered to enable nucleic acid delivery to the obtained T cells. Usually, a foreign gene material (RNA or DNA) delivery into human cells can be accomplished using viral or non-viral vectors. Viral vectors are preferable for basic and clinical research because viruses have diverse expression characteristics, spend a fraction of time to reach clinically desired numbers of cultured T cells, and possess high transfer competency ([Zhang et al., 2017](#B346); [Gomes-Silva and Ramos, 2018](#B92)). Viral vectors are used to encode CARs; with their reverse transcription potential, vectors convert RNA into permanently integrated DNA in the genome of the obtained T cells. These viral vectors include retroviruses, lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus. The most popular ones are genetically engineered retroviruses, more frequently used than gamma retroviral vectors. During the activation period, viral vectors are washed out of the culture by dilution and medium exchange ([McGarrity et al., 2013](#B198); [Zhang et al., 2017](#B346)).\n\nHowever, viral vectors present a possible safety hazard. The limitations of the viral vectors include tumorigenesis and toxicity caused by the insertion mutation used to generate immune reactions, and the limited carrier capacity and achieved titers are not sufficient ([Wang et al., 2008](#B309)). Therefore, to overcome the shortcomings of viral vectors, other methods such as mRNA transfection and non-viral vectors were used in the production of CAR-T cells. The most common were transposon-based non-viral vectors, facilitating safe and consistent DNA transfer into CAR T-cells. The sleeping beauty (SB) transposon system is the currently used substitute for viral-based vectors. It has been used to prepare CD19+ CAR T-cells with antitumor properties *in vivo* and *in vitro* ([Singh et al., 2015](#B265); [Chicaybam et al., 2019](#B46)). In 2014, an optimized protocol (GMP-compliant) was suggested to utilize the production of modified CAR T-cells by electroporation with CAR-encoding RNA, which helps in overcoming several drawbacks of classic viral transfection such as viral contamination, low time-efficiency, higher resource consumption, and off-target effects ([Krug et al., 2014](#B157)). In 2019, the optimized protocol was used in producing genetically modified CAR T-cells against melanomas; the CAR T-cells were electroporated and expanded with mRNA that encoded CAR targeting CSPG4, a surface protein highly expressed in most melanomas. The results showed that a high dosage of modified CAR T-cells could lyse 80% of melanoma cells after 20 h; the authors suggested a future expansion of their study to a full clinical trial ([Wiesinger et al., 2019](#B324)).\n\nThis approach has several advantages, such as improved integration of the transduced genetic material due to its low promoter activity ([Yant et al., 2000](#B337)), fewer epigenomic changes at the integration site, and reasonably low manufacturing costs ([Izsvák et al., 2010](#B121)). The only limitation in this approach is the low rate of transgenic material; however, it was considerably enhanced ([Geurts et al., 2003](#B86)). Nevertheless, the concerns remain; for instance, transient mRNA transfection requires several rounds of infusion, the possibility of mutagenesis, and SB transposon remobilization ([Beatty et al., 2014](#B17)). The fifth step is CAR-T cell expansion using bioreactors, which help cells divide and express CARs on the cell surface ([Harrison et al., 2019](#B104)). Finally, when the cells reach the clinically required volume, they are reinfused into the patient as a therapeutic agent. The infusion occurs 48–96 h after lymphodepletion chemotherapy to make room for the infused CAR-T cells ([Turtle et al., 2016](#B299)). The patient is then kept under observation for possible adverse effects within the first few days of infusion. The process lasts around 3 weeks, where cell preparation is the most time-consuming phase of treatment ([Zhao and Cao, 2019](#B352)) ([Figure 2](#F2)).\n\n### FIGURE 2.\n\n[![FIGURE 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/58e72344c3de/fbioe-10-797440-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9256991_fbioe-10-797440-g002.jpg)\n\n![FIGURE 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/58e72344c3de/fbioe-10-797440-g002.jpg)\n\nClinical production of CAR T-cells. The peripheral blood is withdrawn from the patient (autologous) or it can be obtained from the peripheral blood of a healthy donor (mononuclear cells), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), or umbilical cord blood (allogeneic). The targeted T-cells are obtained by leukapheresis. Then, the T cells are separated and purified from other leukocytes using anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads; this process is followed by activation of the cells. Then, the genetic material encoding chimeric receptors is introduced into the T-cells via several known methods (such as mRNA transfection), viral vectors (e.g., lentivirus), or sleeping beauty (SB) transposons. The engineered T-cells expressing CARs are then expanded in a bioreactor. The patient receives chemotherapy for decreasing white cells blood count; after 48–96 h, the CAR T-cells are reinfused into the patient, followed by close monitoring for a few days to observe any adverse effects.\n\nInterestingly, lymphodepletion chemotherapy is a crucial step before CAR T-cells infusion as it reduces endogenous lymphocyte numbers, thus increasing hemostatic cytokine availability promoting infused cells survival ([Liang et al., 2020](#B172)). Administration of T-cells to lymphodepleted patients has shown superior anti-tumor properties compared to lymphoreplete patients ([Bechman and Maher, 2021](#B18)). There have been several benefits to the lymphodepletion regimens, such as the non-myeloablative chemotherapeutic approach; this regimen results in the removal of endogenous lymphocytes that act as “cytokines sinks,” which facilitate the accessibility of the infused T-cells to hemostatic cytokines like IL-15, IL-7, and IL-2, which stimulate JAK-STAT-mediated expansion ([Gattinoni et al., 2005](#B85); [Neelapu, 2019](#B212)). In a lymphodepleted host, the memory cells proliferate in an antigen-dependent manner, unlike naïve T cells homeostatic expansion, which occurs in an MHC-dependent manner ([Gattinoni et al., 2005](#B85); [Klebanoff et al., 2005](#B148)). It has been reported that lymphodepletion decreases immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), while enhancing the APC cells’ functionality and availability ([Bechman and Maher, 2021](#B18)). Immunosuppressive networks are negatively affected by lymphodepleting agents such as tryptophan metabolizing enzyme and indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) ([Hanafi et al., 2014](#B101); [Ninomiya et al., 2015](#B216)). Lymphodepletion also exerts certain positive effects on the microbiome. It enhances the translocation of microbes from the gastrointestinal tract, which lead to immunostimulatory impacts through Toll-like receptor ligation, resulting in an augmented release of IL-1β ([Viaud et al., 2013](#B302); [Lee et al., 2019](#B162)). According to imaging studies, post lymphodepletion, the tumor-trafficking properties of adoptively infused cytotoxic T-cells were enhanced ([Pittet et al., 2007](#B227)). In a clinical trial ([NCT03939026](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03939026)), which evaluates the safety and efficacy of certain lymphodepletion regimens, the phase I results suggest that fludarabine as a component in the lymphodepletion regimen is critical and contributes to the efficacy of the procedure. Moreover, using a combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy) regimen is beneficial in multiple tumors; however, this combination is required for optimization in certain types of cancer and attenuation of the exerted toxicities of these agents. Although the benefits of lymphodepletion are undeniable, there have been certain limitations, such as the short-lived span of lymphodepletion and the consequent immune restoration phase accompanied by a compensatory overshoot of both MDSCs and Tregs as indicated by preclinical and clinical studies ([Bechman and Maher, 2021](#B18)).\n\nThe mechanism of action of CAR T-cell involve the binding of CARs to a targeted antigen present on tumor cell surface via scFV recognition domain, which elicit anti-tumoral effects through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), cytolytic effector function via perforin and granzyme ([Benmebarek et al., 2019](#B19)), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which binds to death receptors (e.g., DR4 and DR5) on tumor cells cell surface to activate graft-versus tumor effect (donor T-cells) ([Watanabe et al., 2021](#B319)). Also, tumor cell apoptosis can be initiated via the activation of caspase 8 and the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) leading to cell death mediated by mature caspase 3 subsequent cleavage of over 500 cellular substrate as a result of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) pathway activation ([Waring and Müllbacher, 1999](#B318); [Nagata and Tanaka, 2017](#B211)) ([Figure 3](#F3)).\n\n### FIGURE 3.\n\n[![FIGURE 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/79bbf1c9f629/fbioe-10-797440-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9256991_fbioe-10-797440-g003.jpg)\n\n![FIGURE 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/79bbf1c9f629/fbioe-10-797440-g003.jpg)\n\nCAR T-cell action: **(A)** CAR T-cells recognition of targeted antigen. **(B)** Chimeric antigen receptor binding to tumor-antigen. **(C)** Initiation of the antitumor (cytolytic) effects where the activated T-cells downstream the killing signaling by secreting granzymes and perforins, pro-inflammatory cytokines due to immune cell invasion, as well as initiating the expression of TRAIL and FasL pathways.\n\n## 5 Clinical Applications of CAR-T Cells\n\n### 5.1 Hematological Malignancies\n\n#### 5.1.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n\nCAR-T cells are primarily used in hematological malignancies such as Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), characterized by a rapid proliferation of naïve cells in the bone marrow. CAR-T cells showed efficacy in treating ALL, especially the engineered T cells against CD19, as CD19 is a highly expressed biomarker of the B-cell lineage, responsible for B-cell malignancy of ALL. CD19 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in B-cell activation and is expressed throughout the developmental stages of B cells ([Wang et al., 2012](#B310)). Another potential target in B-ALL is the light chain of immunoglobulin CD20 ([Gill et al., 2016](#B88); [Jain and O’Brien, 2016](#B125)). Conversely, T-cell malignancy of ALL (T-ALL) showed limited efficacy when the engineered CAR T-cells targeted CD19; therefore, another target (anti-CD5) showed effective elimination of a specific T-cell line expressing CD5 ([Mamonkin et al., 2015](#B189)). Anti-CD4 CAR-T cells are potential targets showing promising results against T-cell lymphoma (CD4 positive) models *in vivo* and *in vitro* ([Pinz et al., 2016](#B226))*.* Clinical trials evaluating multitargeted CAR-T cell therapy against ALL, such as single engineered CAR-T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 and a combination of CAR-T cells with anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 to target each antigen independently, have yielded encouraging results ([Huang et al., 2018](#B118)). KYMRIAH ™ (tisagenlecleucel), which is a second generation CAR-T cell product (4-1BB costimulatory domain) directed against CD19 antigen, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ALL in 2017 based on multicenter clinical studies, which established an overall remission rate of 81% in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory acute B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-cell ALL), and a best overall response rate of 52% in adults with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) ([Thudium Mueller et al., 2021](#B293)).\n\n#### 5.1.2 Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) results from genetic alterations in precursor cells that affect the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, resulting in the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. These cells are incapable of turning into mature hematopoietic cells. CAR-T cell therapy in AML did not show the same success as seen in ALL, and the target of CAR T-cells in AML was CD123 and CD33; the latter was used in treating a patient and showed a significant reduction in tumor volume in the bone marrow; however, 9 weeks post-infusion, the patient experienced a relapse ([Wang et al., 2015](#B313)). Furthermore, the use of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells as a potential treatment of AML showed inadequate potency in “on-target-off-tumor” since CD123 is also expressed in normal tissues (e.g., endothelial tissue) and monocytes in relatively low levels compared with AML ([Tettamanti et al., 2014](#B290)). Therefore, other antigens have been investigated as new targets, including Lewis-Y (LeY) and CLEC12A antigens, and anti-LeY CART-cells were used in patients who eventually developed disease progression.\n\nIn contrast, the CD33was used as anti-CLEC12A-CD33 CAR T-cells, showed complete remission in a 44-year-old female patient with refractory AML ([Ritchie et al., 2013](#B242); [Morsink et al., 2019](#B207)). In AML the application of CAR T cell therapy is limited by the absence of an AML-specific antigen. AML cells can express several cell surface antigens such as CD34, CD33, CD123, and many more. moreover, these antigens are also expressed by healthy Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their lymphoid and myeloid progenitors ([Cummins and Gill, 2019](#B57)). However, CAR-T cells are unable to distinguish between malignant and normal cells, unlike CD19 CAR T-cells, their complete elimination of the normal and malignant B cells resulting in B cell aplasia is considered clinically benign and manageable by intravenous immunoglobulin infusion; however, this is not the same in targeting myeloid antigens shared with normal myeloid progenitor as their elimination could be fatal due to bleeding complications and neutropenic infections ([Mardiana and Gill, 2020](#B192)). The aggressiveness of this disease and its ability to develop resistance against treatments requires substantial efforts to achieve remission. CAR T-cell therapy is a promising technology; however, the lack of leukemia-specific cell surface antigens could present a problem in designing CAR T-cells against AML ([Mardiana and Gill, 2020](#B192)). HSPCs frequently share antigens with AML. CAR T-cells expansion is threatened by AML blasts or prior exposure to chemotherapy that damages T cells. In addition, the AML’s ability to evade the immune system by inducing various immunosuppressive mechanisms makes it challenging to achieve desired outcomes ([Mardiana and Gill, 2020](#B192)).\n\n#### 5.1.3 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results in excessive mature lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissue ([Kipps et al., 2017](#B144)). The use of CD19 as a target in the case of CLL by producing anti-CD19 CAR-T cells has shown remarkable results in patients with complete remission and minimal residual disease, and anti-CD19-CD28ζ CAR-T cells have shown promising results, according to the data from the National Cancer Institute ([Porter et al., 2011](#B230), [2015](#B229); [Kochenderfer et al., 2015](#B152)). Pharmacokinetics plays an essential role in enhancing the outcomes and safety of CAR-T cell treatments, especially when it comes to the individual persistence of treatments, as it is considered the main goal in achieving the desired long-term antitumor effects ([Norelli et al., 2016](#B217)). In a recent study ([NCT01747486](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01747486)), 42 patients (18 years and above) with CLL were treated with autologous CD19 CAR T-cells and 38 patients were infused with anti-CD19 CAR T-cells. Twenty-eight patients randomly received a low dose of (5 × 107) and high dose of (5 × 108), and 24 were evaluable for response assessment. After a short time, ten patients revived the high dose while eight were evaluable for response assessment. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 75 months; results showed that higher doses effectively induce a complete remission (CR) without excessive toxicities ([Frey et al., 2020](#B76)). One of the inevitable issues in CLL treatment is the antigen-negative relapse that has been threatening CAR T-cell therapy’s success in CLL patients ([Mancikova and Smida, 2021](#B190)). The proportion of remissions in patients with CCL post CAR T-cell therapy remains the lowest compared to the spectrum of B-cell tumor patients. Current data are crucial for utilizing the clinical effects, and ibrutinib administration and partial reversing of the exhausted phenotype of CAR T-cells in CLL patient seem substantially promising. The genetic modification (insertion) of transgenic vector in the recipient T cells with systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 may contribute to treatment efficacy. The low quality of non-functional CAR T-cells derived from treated CLL patients could be improved using allogeneic CAR T-cells. The antigen-negative relapse could be alleviated using bispecific CARs targeting two antigens presented on the tumor cell surface. Suitable biomarkers must be identified and used as targets to design treatment and avoid infusion failure ([Mancikova and Smida, 2021](#B190)).\n\n#### 5.1.4 Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) consists of a group of neoplasms with various degrees of malignancy occurring in lymphocytes, lymphoid tissue, and histocytes at any stage of their development. These heterogeneous lymphoproliferative malignancies have a greater chance of dissemination to extranodal sites and are less predictable than Hodgkin’s lymphomas (HL) ([Singh et al., 2020](#B223)). Anti-CD19 CAR-T cells have shown remarkable results in treating chemo-resistant lymphomas. Patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had complete remission for more than 2 years ([Neelapu et al., 2017a](#B213); [Schuster et al., 2017](#B257); [Tiberghien et al., 2017](#B294)). CD22 is expressed in progenitor and differentiated B cells and is highly expressed in B-cell lymphomas and leukemia. Anti-CD22 showed promising results in four out of nine patients with a negative minimal residual disease and complete remission ([Fry et al., 2015](#B78)). Anti-CD20 and anti-CD23 CAR-T cells have also been used to treat NHL ([Till et al., 2012](#B295); [Zou et al., 2018](#B363)). In 2017, the FDA approved YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel), which is a CD19 directed second generation CAR-T (CD28 co-stimulatory domain) cell product for the treatment of NHL.\n\n#### 5.1.5 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\n\nHodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is a common lymphoma derived from B cells. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells are rarely found in the tissues derived from mature B cells that lose their phenotype and co-express unusual hematopoietic cell markers ([Küppers et al., 2012](#B160)). HL cells highly express CD30; therefore, it was considered an ultimate target by engineered CAR-T cells, and clinical trials showed encouraging results where patients diagnosed with HL exhibited complete remission after anti-CD30 CAR-T cell therapy, wherein other patients either developed stable disease or relapse; however, the observations of anti-CD30 CAR-T cells did not show any toxicities or adverse events ([Ramos et al., 2017](#B235); [Wang et al., 2017](#B306)).\n\n#### 5.1.6 Multiple Myeloma\n\nMultiple myeloma (MM) is also a B-cell malignancy of long-lived plasma cells, which play a significant part in the immune defense system by producing antigen-specific immunoglobulins; in the case of malignancy, these cells excessively produce a specific immunoglobulin (containing two heavy chains and two light chains) and additional light chains, which can be detected in the blood. They are used to diagnose and monitor MM ([Bird and Boyd, 2019](#B23)). Disease management was compromised because of the unavailability of an ideal target. Syndecan 1 (CD138) was the target for the treatment of MM. This surface protein was expressed on both plasma cells and normal cells (epithelial), causing “on-target-off-tumor” toxicity. Nonetheless, Chinese clinical trials using CD138 as a target achieved stable disease in 4/5 patients ([Heffner et al., 2012](#B107)). Another target is the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is thought to be involved in all stages of B-cell differentiation and maturation and is highly expressed in myeloma cells; therefore, it is considered a better target in CAR-T cell therapy ([Ali et al., 2016](#B9)). A phase 1 clinical trial showed preliminary results regarding BCMA (anti-CD269) CAR-T cell therapy; one patient achieved complete remission for more than 3 months, whereas another patient showed an outstanding partial response to therapy. Additionally, a correlation was established between high treatment efficacy and higher doses. However, the higher the dosage, the more adverse events were seen, such as cytokine release syndrome, regardless of the use of BCMA or CD138 in therapy ([Yang X. et al., 2019](#B336)). The expression levels of CD19 in the plasma cells were low, but they were observed to be slightly higher in malignant cells and showed remission in a 43-year-old patient using CTL019 cells and CD19 as a target in MM. Cytokine release syndrome did not develop, and following several days of infusion, CTL019 cells were detected in the bone marrow and blood ([Garfall et al., 2015](#B82)). BCMA CAR T-cells were designed with signaling domain (CD3ζ) and CD28 (costimulatory domain) in a study ([NCT02215967](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02215967)) conducted with 24 patients with MM; the cytotoxicity observed was minor post an infusion of a minimum dose (0.3–3.0 × 106 cells/kg). The objective response rate (ORR) was 20%. The anti-tumor function with 81% ORR, while severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in higher dosage of CAR T-cells (9 × 106 cells/kg) ([Brudno et al., 2018](#B27)). Bispecific CAR T-cell (LCAR-B38M) was designed to target VHH1 and VHH2 epitopes of BCMA in a multicenter study ([NCT03090659](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03090659)) on patients with MM. The findings included 88% ORR and 68% CR. The adverse events included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, CRS, and pyrexia ([Zhao W.-H. et al., 2018](#B353)). In 2021, the FDA approved ABECMA (idecabtagene vicleucel) for MM. ABCEMA is a second generation CAR-T cell product directed against the BCMA tumor antigen.\n\n### 5.2 Solid Tumors\n\n#### 5.2.1 Renal Cancer\n\nRenal cancer (RCC) is one of the most diagnosed cancers in both men and women worldwide. RCC development is associated with several factors, including chronic kidney disease, smoking, hypertension, and obesity ([Rossi et al., 2018](#B245); [Capitanio et al., 2019](#B33)). For many years, surgical intervention was the most effective treatment for RCC, known for its chemoresistance. Later, other treatments such as cytokine and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were approved, and when RCC showed possible immunological sensitivity, other immunotherapies were approved as well ([Schepisi et al., 2020](#B253)). CAR-T cell therapy of RCC targets carboxy-anhydrase-IX (CA-IX) as an antigen, which participates in the catalysis of carbon dioxide hydration ([Bagley and O’Rourke, 2020](#B13); [Bagley and O’Rourke, 2020](#B13)) and is considered a critical antigen in RCC; however, it is also found in other normal tissues of gastric mucosa epithelium, small intestine epithelium, duodenum, and the biliary tree where it is expressed moderately ([Yeku et al., 2017](#B340)). The expression of CA-IX can be induced under hypoxic conditions in various tissues ([Tafreshi et al., 2014](#B285)). The first generation of CA-IX/CART-cells toward RCC was associated with high cytokine secretion due to cytotoxicity ([Li et al., 2018](#B170)).\n\n#### 5.2.2 Ovarian Cancer\n\nNovel therapeutics are constantly required in Ovarian cancer (OC) as it is known for its high recurrence levels post-surgery and multi-agent chemotherapies. CAR-T cells are a novel therapy. In the context of ovarian cancer, they target tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG72); humanized TAG72-specific CAR-T cells exhibited cytokine production and cytotoxic activity in OC. In contrast, it also showed proliferation reduction and increased mouse viability in mouse models ([Murad et al., 2018](#B210)). Another target was mucin 16 (MUC16), which causes OC progression depletion after intraperitoneal and intravenous injection in mouse models, making it one of the potential targets, and an *in-vitro* study using Her-2 CAR-T cells on human OC cell line (SKOV3) expressing Her-2/neu reported growth suppression potential ([Chekmasova et al., 2010](#B43)). The antigen mesothelin was targeted by anti-Meso CAR-T cells, which inhibited proliferation and increased mouse viability. Additionally, 5T4-specific CAR-T cells and FRα-specific CAR-T cells exhibited inhibitory effects against OC cellular growth and progression ([Zuo et al., 2017](#B365); [Owens et al., 2018](#B219)). In the dual design of CAR-T cells targeting both CD19 and mesothelin (MSLN-CAR NK-92) cells using lentivirus gene transfer, the MSLN-CAR molecules were highly expressed on the surface of NK-92, which led to the killing of MSLN+ OC cells such as SKOV3 and OVCAR3 *in vitro* ([Cao et al., 2020](#B31)).\n\n#### 5.2.3 Lung Cancer\n\nLung cancer is one of the most diagnosed cancers worldwide and is considered one of the leading causes of death. Several antigens have been targeted to treat this cancer, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is highly expressed in the epithelium and epithelium-derived tissues compared with normal lung tissues. Because the receptor provides significant affinity for binding sites in lung carcinomas, it is one of the most therapeutic targets of CAR-T cells. Second-generation EGFR-CAR-T cells with CD137 co-stimulatory domain showed feasibility and safety in treating refractory/relapsed non-small cell lung cancer ([Feng et al., 2016](#B73)). Another candidate target was HER2, as it exhibited good therapeutic outcomes in refractory/recurrent HER2+ sarcomas without any respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) signs. However, RDS was observed 15 min after cell infusion in one patient diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer to the lung and liver, plausibly because of an autoimmune reaction. Generally, the safety and efficacy of this anti-HER2 CAR-T cell in lung cancer depends on the levels of HER1 in patients and might be compromised because of RDS ([Morgan et al., 2010](#B205)).\n\nFurther antigens were considered, including MSLN, since it is expressed in 69% of lung adenocarcinoma (1/5 patients) and not in normal lung tissues and reduced tumor burden in mouse models ([Carpenito et al., 2009](#B35); [Kachala et al., 2014](#B136)). The NSCLCs were found to overexpress transmembrane glycoprotein MUC1 and Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface antigen; therefore, they were preferred to be used in combination as potential targets for MUC1-CAR-T cells and anti-PSCA-CAR-T cells, which showed excellent efficacy compared with using a single antigen ([Wei et al., 2017](#B320)). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is overexpressed in nearly 70% of NSCLCs ([Berinstein, 2002](#B21)); however, patients who received anti-CEA CAR T-cell treatment had transient acute respiratory toxicity, possibly because of the expression of CEACAM5 on lung epithelial cells ([Thistlethwaite et al., 2017](#B291)). The tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) was used as a target; however, toxicity concerns are growing since it was also expressed in normal tissue. Therefore, to overcome this issue, selectivity of the target was improved by engineering CAR T-cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors specific for EpCAM or B7-Homolog 3 (B7-H3), a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules, which is expressed on ROR1+ tumor cells but not on ROR1+ stromal cells, resulting in the regression of tumor cells without causing toxicity ([Srivastava et al., 2019](#B273)). The costimulatory role of CD80/CD86 makes it a suitable target for immune intervention, and upon binding to CTLA4 (CTLA4-CD80/CD86), T cells are downregulated via various mechanisms. In several NSCLC cells, the mRNA expression of CD80/CD86 was detected in normal tissues, risking autoimmunity reactions; hence, new strategies are encouraged to overcome this risk by using CD80/CD86 CAR-T cells and enhancing its selectivity ([Wroblewski et al., 2001](#B327); [Egen et al., 2002](#B70)).\n\n#### 5.2.4 Breast Cancer\n\nBreast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death in women, wherein 1.5 million women are diagnosed with BC worldwide each year. BC is diagnosed during routine screening or incidentally, and it could reach the lymph nodes and metastasize to other organs such as the brain ([Sun et al., 2017](#B281); [Seely and Alhassan, 2018](#B258)). One of the most attractive targets for CAR T-cell therapy is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This type of breast cancer lacks estrogen (ER), progesterone, and epidermal growth factor (EGFR) receptors ([Harrer et al., 2019](#B103)). The targeted receptors for CAR T-cell treatment include folate receptor alpha (FRα); as a result, the anti- FRα CAR T-cells killed *in vitro* TNBC cells. This antitumor activity correlates with the FRα antigen levels in the cells ([Song et al., 2016](#B270)). The MUC1 antigen is associated with different tumor invasiveness and metastatic behavior, including breast cancer, making it a potential treatment target (Zhou et al., 2019). Integrin αvβ3 is another tumor antigen expressed in different tumors, including BC tumors, and stimulates tumor cell survival and metastasis ([Felding-Habermann et al., 2001](#B71)). Tyrosine-protein kinase Met (c-Met) is a cell surface molecule expressed in almost 50% of breast tumors. After an intratumoral injection of c-Met CAR mRNA, the tumors were excised and analyzed via intratumoral injection immunohistochemistry, revealing inflammatory and necrotic responses ([Tchou et al., 2012](#B288); [Zhao et al., 2017](#B354)). The ROR antigen was also used as a CAR T-cell target in BC, eliminating multiple layers of tumor cells deep in the tumor tissues above and beneath the basement membrane ([Wallstabe et al., 2019](#B304)). Recent clinical trials have targeted several antigens against BC, including HER2, MUCI, CEA, CD70, CD133, ROR1, and NKG2D ligands ([Williams et al., 2017](#B325)). The cell surface antigen mesothelin was found to be overexpressed in 67% of TNBC samples and is considered a potential target because of its involvement in the activation of intracellular pathways including MAPK, NFкB, and PI3K, resulting in tumor cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis ([Morello et al., 2016](#B204); [Tchou et al., 2017](#B289)). CSPG4 is a tumor glycoprotein found in 72.7% of TNBC lesions and believed to be associated with tumor cell survival and recurrence; it was primarily detected in TNBC stem cells responsible for resistance and relapse. Using anti-CSPG4 CAR T-cells in TNBC metastasis and progression can also be diminished; it can attack more than one target, including stromal cells, primary TNBC cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are considered to be crucial for maintaining the TME ([Wang et al., 2010](#B314); [Cooney et al., 2011](#B54); [Harrer et al., 2019](#B103)). Disialoganglioside GD2 is a BC stem cell antigen expressed in 35.5% of metastatic TNBC and is considered an immunotherapeutic target, and anti-GD2 CAR T-cells have been reported to show cytolytic activity in GD2+ cell lines ([Seitz et al., 2020](#B260); [Xia et al., 2020](#B329)). The TEM8 marker was found to be overexpressed in the vasculature of solid tumors. When anti-TEM8 CAR T-cells were used in the TNBC mouse model, explicit control of the tumor growth was observed without exhibiting any toxicity. On the other hand, in healthy mouse models, cytotoxic effects were observed, which might be due to the retroviral vectors used that might have affected the abundance of CAR T-cells ([Risma and Jordan, 2012b](#B241); [Chaudhary et al., 2012](#B42); [Byrd et al., 2018](#B29)). Another intriguing target is the human endogenous retrovirus family K (HERV-K) antigen, highly expressed in basal BC cells, similar to TNBC. Importantly, it is absent in nearly all normal human tissues. The anti-K CAR T-cells experimented with *in-vivo* BC mouse models showed slow tumor growth. The MDA-MB-231 cell line showed great lysis post-exposure to anti-K CAR T-cells prepared from cells obtained from patients with BC ([Zhao et al., 2011](#B351); [Wang-Johanning et al., 2012](#B317); [Krishnamurthy et al., 2015](#B156); [Zhou et al., 2015](#B361), [2016](#B362); [Johanning et al., 2017](#B130)).\n\n#### 5.2.5 Prostate Cancer\n\nThe second most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men is prostate cancer (PrC) and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. According to GLOBOCAN 2018, the number of newly reported diagnoses in 2018 reached 1,276,106 cases worldwide, with a higher incidence in developed countries ([Rawla, 2019](#B238)). Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been used as a target by CAR T-cells in studies (*in vivo* and *in vitro*) and causes the proliferation and differentiation of PSMA+ cells ([Maher et al., 2002](#B184); [Gade et al., 2005](#B79)). In mouse models of metastatic PrC, diabetes, and severe combined immunodeficiency, the use of PSMA CAR T-cells eradicated metastatic PrC cells. The second generation CAR T-cells (containing co-stimulator CD28) offer a novel immune-targeted approach for metastatic PrC since it showed a better eradication effect than the previous generation ([Ma et al., 2014](#B178); [Zuccolotto et al., 2014](#B364)). The anti-PSMA CAR T-cell dosage and protocols for metastatic PrC patients is being investigated in phase 1 clinical trials, in addition to the possible use of dual-targeted CAR T-cells targeting PSMA and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and their safety in another phase 1 clinical trial ([Slovin et al., 2013](#B267); [Kloss et al., 2018](#B149)). The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is also an attractive target for CAR T-cell therapy; the first generation of CAR T-cells with the scFV of 7F5 antibodies exhibits antitumor effects in mice. In another study that used the 4-1BB co-stimulator, the activation of T cells was better than that by the CD28 co-stimulator ([Hillerdal et al., 2014](#B114); [Priceman et al., 2018](#B232)). As a potential strategy, combined CAR T-cell therapy uses low-affinity PSCA CAR T-cells and high-affinity PSMA CAR T-cells to eliminate double-positive CAR T-cells in PrC ([Feldmann et al., 2017](#B72)). A different approach is to use diabodies (bispecific antibodies; BITEs) that simultaneously bind to specific T-cell receptor-associated molecules on the T-cell surface (e.g., CD3ε) and to a tumor-specific antigen expressed on the cancer cell surface (e.g., CD19; PSMA). The simultaneous engagement of BITEs with both CD3 and the specific antigen resulted in tumor cell lysis via the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. BITEs have also been reported to be overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal ones ([Stone et al., 2012](#B278); [Stieglmaier et al., 2015](#B277); [Yang et al., 2016](#B333)). These novel antibodies were evaluated in combating cells by targeting PSMA ([Baum et al., 2012](#B16); [Friedrich et al., 2012](#B77); [Feldmann et al., 2017](#B72)). In animal models, these novel antibodies failed to block the proliferative activity of cancer; they only caused delayed tumor growth, which suggests that the use of diabodies as a single treatment would not achieve a sturdy cellular memory response ([Hillerdal and Essand, 2015](#B113)). However, in murine xenograft PrC models, the humanized bispecific antibody MOR209/ES414 caused tumor growth inhibition and improved survival. PSMA expression was reduced only in transferred and adaptive human T cells. In a recent study on xenograft models, BITE targets CD3 in T cells and PSMA in PrC cells. The results revealed their antitumor potential ([Hernandez-Hoyos et al., 2016](#B111); [Bailis et al., 2019](#B14)). An additional target of PrC is the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM; also known as CD326), a known stem cell antigen present in several tumors, including PrC ([Gires et al., 2009](#B89); [Ni et al., 2012](#B215)). Recently in Europe, EpCAM-CD3 was approved for the treatment of malignant ascites. Using it as a TAA, it was developed to produce anti-EpCAM CAR T-cells capable of combating PC3M cells overexpressing EpCAM, thereby extending the survival of under-expressing EpCAM PC3 cells. However, further investigation of its efficacy in metastatic PrC is needed ([Deng et al., 2015](#B62)).\n\n#### 5.2.6 Liver Cancer\n\nLiver cancer is a global health burden, with an estimated >1 million cases by 2025. The most frequently diagnosed type of liver cancer is hepatocellular cancer (HCC), contributing ∼90% of all diagnosed cases. Many risk factors play a role in the progression of various diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infection, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome ([Llovet et al., 2021](#B176)). The glypican-3 (GPC3) cell surface has been targeted in CAR T-cell therapy against the HCC xenograft mouse model and proved effective ([Gao et al., 2014](#B81); [Jiang Z. et al., 2016](#B129)). Other targets are being investigated, including MUC 1, CEA, and epithelial cell adhesion molecules ([Chen et al., 2018](#B45); [Katz et al., 2019](#B138)). A different target is the deletion-mutation form of EGFR (known as EGFRvIII), expressed in a wide range of cancer tissues, including HCC tissues. It was identified as a suitable target by CAR T-cells in an *in vivo* model (female BALB/cA-nude mice) and an *in vitro* SMMC7721 cell line (expressing high levels of EGFRvIII). The researchers used CAR T-cells by applying the transposon system (piggyBac), and the results showed antitumor effects in both *in vivo* and *in vitro* models ([Ma et al., 2020](#B179)).\n\n#### 5.2.7 Gastric Cancer\n\nGastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the second cause of cancer-related death. Each year, the number of diagnosed patients is 990,000, of which 738,000 die ([Machlowska et al., 2020](#B180)). Different CAR T-cell targets against GC have been investigated, including folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) ([Kim M. et al., 2018](#B142)). HER2 is also a target in GC, and anti-HER2 CAR-T cells showed antitumor effects in MKN1 cells and mouse xenografts derived from a GC cell line with HER2 expression ([Song et al., 2017](#B271)). Several markers with diagnostic and functional importance have been studied as targets in GC, such as claudin 18.2 (CLDN 18.2), EpCAM, MUC1, CEA, EGFR2, natural-killer receptor group 2, member D (NKG2D), and MSLN. Other possible biomarkers that hold immense potential in GC include actin-related protein 2/3 (APR 2/3), desmocollin 2 (DSC2), B7H6 ligand, neuropilin-1 (NPR-1), cancer-related antigens CA-72-4 and CA-19-9, and anion exchanger 1 (AF1) ([Zhang Q. et al., 2016](#B348)). The use of anti-PSCA CAR T-cells on BGC-823, MKN-28, and KATO III GC cell lines and xenograft GC mouse models showed antitumor cytotoxicity post CAR T-cells peritoneal injection in mouse models resulted in tumor progression restriction ([Wu et al., 2020](#B328)).\n\n#### 5.2.8 Colorectal Cancer\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has reached 1.85 million cases worldwide. The mortality rate has reached more than 850,000 deaths per year, making it the third most common cause of death among cancer-related deaths ([Biller and Schrag, 2021](#B22)). The targeted antigens in CRC are NKG2D, CEA, EGFR, MUC1, HER2, and CD133 ([Li et al., 2021](#B169)). The membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase2C (GUCY2C) has been used as a CAR T-cell target. It showed antitumor activity in both human and syngeneic xenograft CRC mouse models and is expressed in the intestinal apical surface, epithelial cells, and a proportion of the hypothalamic neurons ([Magee et al., 2016](#B182), [2018](#B181)). Anti-EpCAM CAR T-cells used against CRC cells and models exhibited cytotoxic lysis of the targeted cells that secreted cytotoxic cytokines, including IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), resulting in tumor growth and development in xenograft mouse models ([Zhang et al., 2019](#B344)). The tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) was used as a CAR T-cell target in CRC. It was infused in patients via the hepatic artery and intravenously. The CAR T-cells were confirmed in the blood, and trafficking to the tumor tissue was confirmed by tumor biopsy. The results showed antitumor effects of the anti-TAG-72 CAR T-cells. However, the metastatic deposits were resistant to these cells and escaped the immune attack ([Hege et al., 2017](#B109)). Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (TME) and tumor progression, is a novel target for CRC immunotherapy and anti-DCLK1 CAR T-cells resulted in cytotoxicity and secretion of IFN-γ after incubation with CRC cells in two. Higher secretion levels were observed in three-dimensional cultures ([Sureban et al., 2019](#B283)).\n\n#### 5.2.9 Pancreatic Cancer\n\nPancreatic cancer (PaC) incidence has increased over the past few years, comprising 2% of all diagnosed malignancies and 5% of cancer-related deaths. Early diagnosis of PaC is challenging, and symptoms are not detectable at the early stages of the disease up to the advanced and metastatic settings. Most patients relapse, and the 5-year survival rate is 2% ([Zhao and Liu, 2020](#B358)). CXCR2-expressing CAR T-cells migrate more efficiently toward interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-8 containing TME, leading to a higher antitumor activity against αvβ6-expressing PaC xenografts ([Whilding et al., 2019](#B323)). B7-H3, also known as the CD276 antigen, was targeted by CAR T-cells in pancreatic adenocarcinoma *in vitro* and a metastatic xenograft mouse model, which proved efficacy ([Du et al., 2019](#B67)). Anti-CD133 CAR T-cells showed inhibitory activity against potential metastatic cells in HCC, colorectal carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma in phase I clinical trial ([Wang et al., 2018](#B316)). Other known antigens are being investigated for PaC CAR T-cell therapy, such as MUC-1 ([Qu et al., 2004](#B233)), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) ([Tran et al., 2013](#B297)), PSCA ([Wu et al., 2020](#B328)), CEA ([Gansauge et al., 1996](#B80)), mesothelin ([Argani et al., 2001](#B11)), CD24 ([Jacob et al., 2004](#B124)), and HER-2 ([Komoto et al., 2009](#B153)).\n\n#### 5.2.10 Brain Cancer\n\nThe burden of the brain and central nervous system cancers is high. However, they occur rarely and comprise approximately 1.5% of all diagnosed cancers, 80% of all adult primary brain cancers are gliomas, and the relative 5-year survival rate is 22% in brain cancer ([Sandler et al., 2021](#B251)). Various targets of CAR T-cells in brain cancer have been studied, including EGFRvIII, which has several limitations, including adverse events such as dyspnea and hypoxia in patients. Another potential end is that the heterogenic expression of this target in glioma tumors might lead to the accumulation of resistant variants able to escape CAR T-cell therapy ([Goff et al., 2019](#B90); [Rutkowska et al., 2019](#B248)). In a human pilot study where IL-13Rα2 was used as a target for CAR-T cells in treating glioblastoma via multiple intracranial infusions, the treatment was well-tolerated and antitumor activity was observed in patients ([Brown et al., 2015](#B25)). A study on HER2 as a target showed that the third generation HER2-specific CAR-T cells with enhanced activity combined with PD-1 blockade successfully eliminated glioblastoma cells ([Shen et al., 2019](#B263)). Additionally, HER2-specific CAR T-cells were infused in 17 patients. The infusion was well-tolerated, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and CAR T-cell persistence was detected for up to 12 months after infusion. No disease progression was observed during 24–29 months of follow-up ([Ahmed et al., 2017](#B8)). B7-H3 was targeted against glioblastoma in mouse models, and anti-B7-H3 Car T-cells led to significant tumor regression and extended survival ([Tang et al., 2019](#B287)). B7-H3 mRNA exists in all normal tissues, but the microRNAs inhibit its translation; however, conditions such as inflammation might elicit B7-H3 expression in these tissues, making them a target of anti-B7-H3 CAR T-Cells ([Xu et al., 2009](#B331)). The inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase, known as CD147, is responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix, allowing for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis ([Xiong et al., 2014](#B330)). CD147 expression in glioma is significantly higher than that in normal tissues, and its expression is correlated with patient prognosis ([Yang et al., 2013](#B335); [Li et al., 2017a](#B168)). A phase 1 clinical trial was performed to evaluate the anti-CD147 effect in recurrent glioblastoma patients; however, low levels of this antigen in several normal tissues despite high levels in malignant tissues sparked concern ([Riethdorf et al., 2006](#B239); [Liao et al., 2011](#B173); [Tseng et al., 2020](#B298)). GD2 is also expressed in glioblastoma patient samples and cell lines ([Golinelli et al., 2018](#B91)). Anti-GD2 CAR T-cells exhibited cytotoxic activity against neuroblastoma cell lines *in vitro* and subcutaneously grafted cell lines in mouse models and successfully eliminated orthotopic patient-derived diffuse midline glioma xenograft models ([Prapa et al., 2015](#B231); [Mount et al., 2018](#B208)). Chlorotoxin (CLTX) is found in the death stalker scorpion venom [([DeBin et al., 1993](#B60)). CLTX was found to selectively bind to primary tumor cells, while it is hardly detectable in different types of normal brain tissues ([Lyons et al., 2002](#B177)). CLTX directed-CAR T-cells were generated to target glioblastoma, which exhibited antitumor activity in orthotopic xenograft mouse models ([Wang D. et al., 2020](#B308)). NKG2D receptors are expressed in glioblastoma stem-like cells ([Flüh et al., 2018](#B75); [Yang D. et al., 2019](#B332)). Chemotherapy or radiotherapy upregulates the expression of the NKG2D ligand in glioblastoma cells; therefore, the combination of radiotherapy and anti-NKG2D CAR T-cells led to the prolonged survival of immunocompetent mice grafted with intracranial glioma cells ([Weiss et al., 2018](#B321)). In human differentiated glioblastoma cells and cancer initiation cells, and subcutaneous tumor models showed cellular eradication after CAR T-cell therapy; however, NKG2D-ligands on normal tissues are expressed under distress, which may result in human toxicity ([Yang D. et al., 2019](#B332)). In preclinical studies, various targets, such as carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), CD70, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma A2 (EphA2), and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) ([Maggs et al., 2021](#B183)).\n\n#### 5.2.11 Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an incurable, rare, and aggressive type of cancer that initiates at the serosal surfaces, including pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and the vaginalis (in males), as a result of asbestos exposure, with an approximate survival of 8–14 months ([Andujar et al., 2016](#B10); [Carbone et al., 2019](#B34); [Klampatsa and Albelda, 2020](#B145)). In the United States, the incidence rate reached 3,200 diagnosed cases/year ([Jane Henley et al., 2013](#B126)), while in Europe, the cases are constant and are expected to have an increased trend between 2020 and 2025 ([Carbone et al., 2019](#B34)). MPM has three main histological mesothelioma subtypes: sarcomatoid, biphasic, and epithelioid ([Yang et al., 2008](#B334)). The disease is characterized by a significant therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis ([Klampatsa and Albelda, 2020](#B145)). Preclinical studies using mRNA electroporation exhibited potent anti-tumor effects ([Zhao et al., 2010](#B355)). In light of this, an initial study focusing (NCT01355695) on toxicity assessment was conducted using T-cells with transient expression of second-generation murine anti-mesothelin CAR containing CD3ζ and 41BB signaling domains ([Maus et al., 2013](#B197); [Beatty et al., 2014](#B17)); in phase I safety trial none of the patients exhibited “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity post-infusion, and there was no evidence of clinical responses ([Beatty et al., 2014](#B17); [Klampatsa et al., 2017](#B146)). However, an immediate anaphylactic reaction was observed in one of the patients post a delayed infusion of mesothelin CAR T cell, which was linked to the immunogenicity of the murine SS1 scFV used in the construction of CAR ([Maus et al., 2013](#B197)). After the safety confirmation of the transient CAR mesothelin expression, a second phase I clinical trial ([NCT02159716](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02159716)) was conducted on 15 patients with mesothelioma, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer; the used CARs were expressing the same second-generation murine-based anti-mesothelin constructed using a lentiviral transduction vector ([Haas et al., 2019](#B100)). In this trial, two doses of T-cells were administered, and some cohorts used a lymphodepleting agent (cyclophosphamide). Although cyclophosphamide improved CART-meso expansion but did not enhance persistence beyond 28 days, the best overall response reported was stable disease in 11/15 patients ([Haas et al., 2019](#B100)). A third clinical trial ([NCT03054298](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03054298)) was conducted using an active, fully human anti-mesothelin CAR and cyclophosphamide, administered via intravenous and intrapleural routes, respectively, to enhance the overall persistence and efficacy of CAR T-cells. In addition, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a mesothelin-targeting CAR T cell trial to treat malignant pleural disease, including MPM ([NCT02414269](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02414269)) based on preclinical studies of an orthotopic MPM mouse model. The study demonstrated that intrapleural administration of mesothelin CAR T-cell therapy was potent and had long-lasting antitumor efficacy ([Adusumilli et al., 2014](#B5)). The phase I/II clinical trial used CAR with human-derived anti-mesothelin scFV and CD3Z/CD28 signaling domain transduced by a retroviral vector; the CARs were administered via the intrapleural route in patients with primary and secondary pleural malignancies, with MPM patients being the main target population. A subset of the MPM patients had a subsequent administration of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (Pembrolizumab) to assess its efficacy in maintaining the prolonged activity of CAR T-cell therapy. Of the 27 patients who received cyclophosphamide, CAR T-cell therapy, and three doses of Pembrolizumab, 63% achieved either partial or complete response. Also, the CAR T-cells persisted and lasted for up to 42 weeks in the pleural fluid ([Adusumilli et al., 2019](#B7)).\n\n### 5.3 HIV Infection\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects crucial cells in the human immune system, such as DCs, macrophages, and T helper cells (CD4+ T cells) ([Cunningham et al., 2010](#B58)). The deterioration of CD4+ T cells below critical levels renders the body susceptible to opportunistic infections (OIs) and the advancement of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ([Okoye and Picker, 2013](#B218)). HIV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an essential role in recognizing viral antigens presented by HLA class I and killing the infected cells, resulting in limited viral replication *in vivo*; however, CTLs fail to provide sustainable HIV replication control without the use of a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) ([Jones and Walker, 2016](#B132)). The CTL responses still fail to clear the virus from the body, even when using cART to delay disease progression and increase life expectancy. HIV remains an incurable disease, and one of the main reasons behind the failure of the immune system to clear out HIV infection is the reduction or absence of HIV viral antigen expression on infected yet latent CD4+ T cells that act as viral reservoirs ([Churchill et al., 2016](#B51)). Viral reservoirs have been targeted by one strategy known as “kick and kill” or “shock and kill.” This approach suggests the induction of the virus from the latent cells to promote HIV eradication via cell death or by immune surveillance, which clears the viral reservoir ([Kim Y. et al., 2018](#B143)). However, this approach has been investigated in clinical trials using latency reversal agents (LRAs), and the results are not promising ([Rasmussen et al., 2014](#B237); [Spivak et al., 2014](#B272); [Søgaard et al., 2015](#B268)). CAR T-cells are a promising approach for targeting and killing HIV-expressing cells ([Kuhlmann et al., 2018](#B159)) for multiple reasons: 1) long-term immune surveillance provided by CAR T-cells: the effector function of peripheral-derived CAR T-cells has been reported to be maintained for 6 months ([Kalos et al., 2011](#B137); [Kochenderfer et al., 2012](#B151); [Maude et al., 2014](#B196)). Moreover, hematopoietic stem cell (HSPC)-derived CAR T-cells persist longer and provide constant production of CAR T-cells as observed in HIV/AIDS animal models ([Zhen et al., 2017](#B359)). Additionally, HSC-based CAR T-cells were found in several lymphoid tissues in the gut, bone marrow, and several lymph nodes, all of which represent the main replication sites in non-human primate (NHP), infected models, with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) ([Zhen et al., 2017](#B359)). Moreover, the long-lived immunological memory provided by CAR T-cells can be reprogrammed and differentiated into central memory or effector T cells ([Kawalekar et al., 2016](#B139)). 2) The trafficking capability of CAR T-cells to various types of tissues, including the central nervous system, is considered a potential harbor for latent HIV ([Marban et al., 2016](#B191)). Penetration of the blood-brain barrier has been a difficult task for drugs; however, evidence of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell trafficking to brain tissues and cancer cell elimination supports the concept that CAR-T cells may effectively target HIV reservoirs in the brain tissues ([Grupp et al., 2013](#B96); [Maude et al., 2014](#B196)). Homing receptors can be added to CAR T-cells to increase their presence in the B cell follicle, which is another important HIV reservoir difficult for CTLs to target ([Haran et al., 2018](#B102)). 3) The ability of CAR T-cells to target antigen in an MHC-independent manner helps in targeting HIV-infected cells and avoids viral downregulation of MHC-1 that leads to immune escape ([Collins et al., 1998](#B52); [Goulder and Walker, 1999](#B94); [Wonderlich et al., 2011](#B326)). The HIV CAR T-cell therapy targeted the primary HIV cellular receptor CD4, infused with CD3ζ signaling domain (CD4ζ) ([Mitsuyasu et al., 2000](#B202); [Walker et al., 2000](#B303); [Deeks et al., 2002](#B61)). The reason behind choosing CD4 as the reactive antigen in anti-HIV CAR T-cell design is its extensive targeting of all HIV isolates. Additionally, the binding sites of CD4 on the envelope protein are well preserved ([Wang et al., 2019](#B307)). The first generation CD4-based CAR-T cells have been tested in several clinical trials on HIV patients ([Mitsuyasu et al., 2000](#B202); [Walker et al., 2000](#B303); [Deeks et al., 2002](#B61)). The results showed a lack of durable control over viral replication; however, no treatment-associated toxicities were observed, and the persistence of modified cells continued for more than 10 years ([Mitsuyasu et al., 2000](#B202)). The first generation of CAR T-cells had certain impediments, such as limited *in vivo* expansion, susceptibility to apoptosis, and cytotoxicity ([Heuser et al., 2003](#B112); [Zhao et al., 2009](#B356)). CAR T-cells were optimized into the second generation by adding costimulatory domains 4-1BB, resulting in 50-fold more compelling *in vitro* suppression of HIV replication than the previous generation ([Leibman et al., 2017](#B163)). *In vivo* studies showed that second generation CAR T-cells had superior expansion in response to the antigen, provided protection to CD4+ T-cells against HIV infection, and CD4 reduction was decreased compared to the CARs without costimulatory molecules ([Leibman et al., 2017](#B163)). The costimulatory domain 4-1BB is superior in reducing viral rebound than the CD28 domain after antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 4-1BB-induced T-cell perseverance in the absence of the antigen ([Zhang et al., 2007](#B347); [Leibman et al., 2017](#B163)). Developing third generation CARs with multiple costimulatory molecules enhanced effector function, survival, and proliferation. It also enhanced tumor targeting and killing ([Savoldo et al., 2011](#B252)). Using the third generation CARs with CD3z-CD28-4-1BB as multiple domains, targeting the envelope glycoprotein GP120 (gp120) and anti-gp120 CAR T-cells in HIV infection showed increased effectiveness in lysing Env-expressing cells *in vitro* compared to CD4ζ CAR T-cells ([Liu et al., 2016](#B175)). Targeting HIV reservoirs by immune surveillance is difficult because of the ability of the virus to persist in various reservoirs and the lack of viral antigen expression in infected cells. The “kick and kill” strategy cause the transcription reactivation of the latently persistent provirus leading to viral antigen expression, making it detectable by the immune surveillance in ART-treated patients. The ‘kick” strategy can be achieved by potent latency reversal agents (LRAs). Clinical studies in animals showed that LRA was well tolerated *in vivo* and induced HIV expression ([Marsden et al., 2017](#B193)). Although LRAs induce the virus killing by the immune system, it is insufficient, and reservoir eradication is inefficient ([Thorlund et al., 2017](#B292)). The CAR T-cells can exhibit the “kill” response in this strategy along with LRAs; this combination is necessary for effective reservoir eradication ([Bashiri et al., 2018](#B15)) ([Figure 4](#F4)). The kill action in the human system shows that CTLs, either CD8+ or CD4+, induce apoptosis by cytolytic perforin and granzyme ([Yasukawa et al., 2000](#B338)).\n\n#### FIGURE 4.\n\n![FIGURE 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/03501bf0f671/fbioe-10-797440-g004.jpg)\n\n![FIGURE 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/03501bf0f671/fbioe-10-797440-g004.jpg)\n\nHIV reservoir eradication. The “kick and kill” strategy is used to eliminate latently infected cells (reservoir); the “kick” part of this strategy depends on latency reversal agents (LRAs), which induce the virus via transcriptional reactivation of the incorporated provirus within the infected cell. The infected CD4+ T-cell then starts producing and assembling the virus. Upon leaving the cell membrane, the engineered CD8+ CAR T-cell will detect the expressed viral antigens; then, the “kill” action occurs via the secretion of perforin and granzymes, sending the cell into apoptosis.\n\nCAR T-cell therapy has been considered a potential treatment against other infectious diseases such as those caused by opportunistic fungi, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the data gathered from pre-clinical trials have shown promising results ([Seif et al., 2019](#B259)). The number of clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapies is increasing, and their observations are constantly changing, as it is a very attractive field of research with remarkable potential ([Figure 5](#F5)). However, according to [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov), only 21 studies had results in January 2022 ([Table 1](#T1)).\n\n#### FIGURE 5.\n\n[![FIGURE 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/64fc3b23c40a/fbioe-10-797440-g005.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9256991_fbioe-10-797440-g005.jpg)\n\n![FIGURE 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f5b3/9256991/64fc3b23c40a/fbioe-10-797440-g005.jpg)\n\nThe number of clinical trials. Several clinical trials have been investigating various malignancies as recorded by [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov). Based on the data up to January 2022, the number of these clinical trials is rising. The figure shows the number of CAR T-cell therapy clinical trials for hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and HIV infection (total = 789). **(A)** Hodgkin’s lymphoma = 15 studies. **(B)** Acute myeloid leukemia = 35 studies. **(C)** Chronic lymphocytic leukemia = 74 studies. **(D)** Multiple myeloma = 114 studies. **(E)** Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma = 153 studies. **(F)** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia = 157 studies. **(G)** Human Immunodeficiency Virus = 6 studies. **(H)** Prostate Cancer = 10 studies. **(I)** Brain Cancer = 12 studies. **(J)** Renal Cancer = 12 studies. **(K)** Colorectal Cancer = 15 studies. **(L)** Ovarian Cancer = 16 studies. **(M)** Lung Cancer = 22 studies. **(N)** Gastric Cancer = 19 studies. **(O)** Breast Cancer = 19 studies. **(P)** Pancreatic Cancer = 28 studies. **(Q)** Liver Cancer = 29 studies. **(R)** Malignant pleural mesothelioma = 4 studies.\n\n#### TABLE 1.\n\nCAR T-cell clinical trials with recorded results from [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\n| Condition | Enrollment | Status | Antigen | Phase | Results | NCT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| B- cell lymphoma | 43 | Active, not recruiting | Anti-CD19 CAR T-cells | Phase I/phase II | Complete remission (CR) of an assortment of the B-cell malignancies with durability for up to ≥3 years post 51% of anti-CD-19 CAR T-cell treatment with remission of 9 years and going.

Rurik et al. were capable of designing an immunotherapy strategy to generate transient CAR T-cells able to identify fibrotic cells in the heart through injecting CD5-targeted lipid nanoparticles encompassing the needed mRNA to reprogram T lymphocytes, therapeutic CAR T-cells were successfully generated inside the body (*In vivo*). The heart disease in mouse model was analyzed and revealed that this approach has indeed succeeded in fibrosis reduction and cardiac function restoration ([Rurik et al., 2022](#B247)).\n\n## 6 FDA Approved CAR T-Cells Therapies\n\n### 6.1 Axicabtagene Ciloleucel (YESCARTA™)\n\nThe first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CAR T-cell therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel (YESCARTA™) from Kite Pharma approved in 2017, comprises autologous genetically modified T cells designed to produce CAR protein targeting CD19 expressing normal and malignant cells ([Papadouli et al., 2020](#B220)). It is used to treat adult large B-cell Lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. The approval of this drug was based on a single-arm multicenter clinical trial (ZUMA-1; [NCT02348216](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02348216)) conducted on 108 patients diagnosed with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The selection criteria were occurrence of refractory disease post a recent therapy or relapse post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within a year. The patients underwent lymphodepletion before receiving a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. The efficacy was evaluated in 101 patients as follows: ORR 72%, with a complete remission rate (CR) of 51%, the duration of response (DOR) was longer in patients with CR than in patients with partial remission (PR). The median DOR was not reached after 7.9-months (median follow-up). The estimated DOR was 2.1 months. Most common grade 3 (with incident ≥10%) adverse events occurred including fever, febrile neutropenia, encephalopathy, CRS, hypoxia, and hypotension; 25% exhibited severe adverse events, including neurotoxicity, CRS, serious infections, and prolonged cytopenia. In some patients, CRS and neurotoxicity were fatal. The FDA approved axicabtagene ciloleucel with recommendations of mitigation strategy and risk evaluation. The recommended dosage was 2 × 106 viable CAR-positive T cells/kg of body weight, following lymphodepletion chemotherapy by (Flu/Cy) ([Neelapu et al., 2017a](#B213)). In March 2021 (Yescarta, axi-cel), the FDA approved another directed CD19 T-cell therapy to treat adult r/r follicular lymphoma after two lines of therapy. The approval was based on collected data from a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial (ZUMA-5; [NCT03105336](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03105336)). The clinical trial had 81 participants. The results were: ORR 91%, with CM of 60%, the median DOR was not reached within a year of CM rate of 76.2%, patients who underwent leukapheresis (*n* = 123) experienced a ORR of 89% with CM rate 62%. CRS (grade ≥ 3, 10%) occurred in 88%, and neurotoxicity occurred in 51% of all patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma ([Colombo et al., 2021](#B53)).\n\n### 6.2 Tisagenlecleucel (KYMRIAH™)\n\nThe second FDA approved CAR T-cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel (KYMRIAH™) from Novartis pharmaceuticals approved in 2018, is a genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy (CD19 directed) for adult patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma post two or more lines of systemic therapy, including high-grade B-cell lymphoma DLBCL, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. The approval was based on phase II of a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial (JULIET; [NCT02445248](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02445248)) conducted on adults with r/r DLBCL and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma ([Schuster et al., 2019](#B256)). The criteria included a condition that the subject must at least undergo two prior therapy lines with rituximab and anthracycline or have relapsed after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Patients had a single tisagenlecleucel infusion after the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The clinical trial had 68 eligible patients out of 115, and the outcomes were 50% ORR with a 32% CR rate. With a median follow-up time of 9.4 months, patients with the best overall response CR had longer DOR than that of patients with PR. Patients with CR estimated median DOR of (10.0 months) was not reached, while the estimated median DOR among PR patients was 3.4 months. The most common adverse events in 20% of the patients included CRS, pyrexia, nausea, infections-pathogens unspecified, fatigue, diarrhea, headache, edema, and hypotension. The recommended dose of tisagenlecleucel for adults with r/r DLBCL was 0.6–6.0 × 108 CAR-positive viable T-cells ([Schuster et al., 2019](#B256)).\n\n### 6.3 Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (TECARTUS™)\n\nAccelerated approval of brexucabtagene autoleucel (TECARTUS™) was granted by FDA in July 2020; this immunotherapy comprises autologous genetically modified T cells (CD19-directed) for the treatment of adult patients with r/r mantel cell lymphoma (MCL) ([Wang M. et al., 2020](#B312)). The clinical trial behind the approval was a multicenter, single-arm, and open-label (ZUMA-2; [NCT02601313](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02601313)) trial. Seventy-four patients diagnosed with MCL were subjected to this study. These patients previously received anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, anti-CD20 antibody, and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor. After completing lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients received a single infusion of brexucabtagene autoleucel. Sixty out of 74 patients evaluated for efficacy in a minimum duration of 6 months follow-up showed 87% ORR, with a CR rate of 62%. The estimated DOR was not reached (0–29.2 months) after a median DOR of follow-up (8.6 months). Among all 74 patients who underwent leukapheresis, the ORR was 80%, and CR was 55%. The most common adverse reactions with grade 3 or higher (≥10%) included hypoxia, encephalopathy, leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hypophosphatemia, hypertension, hyponatremia, pyrexia, infection-pathogen unspecified, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, and pneumonia. Due to the fatal or life-threatening neurotoxicity and CRS, the FDA approval came with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The recommended dose of brexucabtagene autoleucel was a single IV infusion of (2 × 106 – 2 × 108)CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg body weight post lymphodepleting chemotherapy of (Flu/Cy) ([Wang M. et al., 2020](#B312)).\n\nIn 2021 brexucabtagene autoleucel was approved to treat adult patients with r/r B-cell precursor ALL based on the data gathered from a phase II clinical trial (ZUMA-3; [NCT02614066](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614066)) ([Shah et al., 2021](#B261)). The study had 125 participants diagnosed with r/r B-cell precursor ALL. Patients received a single infusion of brexucabtagene autoleucel post completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The outcomes included CR within 3 months post-infusion. Fifty-four patients were evaluable for efficacy, 28 achieved CR within 3 months with a median follow-up of 7.1 months, the CR median duration was not reached, and the CR duration for more than half of the patients was estimated to exceed 12 months. In 92% of patients, CRS occurred (≥grade 3, 26%); neurotoxicity occurred in 87% (≥Grade 3, 35%); most common adverse events were hypotension, CRS, encephalopathy, fever, chills, headache, rash, edema, nausea, tachycardia, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, hypoxia, diarrhea, tremor, constipation, infection with an unspecified pathogen, vomiting and decreased appetite. The recommended dose was a single IV infusion of brexucabtagene autoleucel (1 × 106–1 × 108) of CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg body weight preceded by (Flu/Cy) lymphodepleting chemotherapy ([Shah et al., 2021](#B261)).\n\n### 6.4 Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (BREYANZI™)\n\nIn February 2021, lisocabtagene maraleucel (BREYANZI™) from Juno Therapeutics was approved by FDA for the treatment of adult patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including high-grade B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B ([Abramson et al., 2020](#B2)). Lisocabtagene maraleucel is a CD19- directed CAR T-cell immunotherapy comprised of autologous genetically modified T cells that produce CAR protein able to identify and eradicate CD19-expressing normal and malignant cells. The immunotherapy efficiency was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial (TRANSCEND, [NCT02631044](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02631044)); 192 patients underwent lymphodepleting chemotherapy before infusion. The outcomes included 73% ORR, with a CR rate of 54%, and the median time of first response was 1 month; 104/192 patients had CR, which lasted at least 6 months (65%), and some patients (62%) had a remission that lasted at least 9 months. The DOR was 16.7 months in patients who achieved CR; and the patients with PR had 1.4 DOR. Adverse events included CRS in 46% of the patients (grade 3 or higher, 4%); neurotoxicity occurred in 35% (grade 3 or higher, 12%). Three patients encountered fatal neurotoxicity. Other grade 3 or higher adverse events were prolonged cytopenia (31%) and infections (19%). Due to the fatal and life-threatening neurotoxicity and CRS, the FDA approval came with recommendations of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The recommended regimen was a single dose of 50–110 × 106 CAR-positive viable T-cells with a ratio of 1:1 of CD4 and CD8 components, intravenous (IV) infusion following (Flu/Cy) lymphodepletion ([Abramson et al., 2020](#B2)).\n\n### 6.5 Idecabtagene Vicleucel (ABECMA™)\n\nOn March 2021, idecabtagene vicleucel (ABECMA™) from Bristol Myers Squibb was approved as the first cell-based immunotherapy for adult patients with r/r multiple myeloma after four or more preceded lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, an immunomodulator, and a proteasome inhibitor ([Munshi et al., 2021](#B209)). It is an autologous genetically modified B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR T-cell therapy. In a multicenter study ([NCT03361748](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03361748)), a total of 127 patients with r/r multiple myeloma were included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the idecabtagene vicleucel; all patients received three (88% had received four or more) lines of antimyeloma therapies. In addition, 100 had received idecabtagene vicleucel with a dosage range of 300–460 × 106 of CAR-positive T-cells. The results showed a 72% ORR and a CR rate of 28%. Approximately 65% of patients had CR for at least 12 months. The most common adverse events included CRS, neurotoxicity, macrophage activation syndrome, prolonged cytopenia. Moreover, infection, fatigue, hypogammaglobulinemia, and musculoskeletal pain were designated as common side effects. Idecabtagene vicleucel was approved with recommendations of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The healthcare facility that houses this therapy must be specially certified to recognize and manage neurotoxicity and CRS. FDA called for a post-marketing observational study conducted by the manufacturer involving the patients treated with idecabtagene vicleucel ([Munshi et al., 2021](#B209)).\n\n### 6.6 Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel (CARVYKTI ™)\n\nThe most recently FDA approved CAR T-cell therapy, in February 2022, is ciltacabtagene autoleucel (CARVYKTI™) from Janssen Biotech, Inc. This drug was approved for the treatment of r/r multiple myeloma post four or more prior lines of therapy including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and a proteosome inhibitor (PI). It is a genetically modified autologous CAR T-cell therapy directed by B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). In a multicenter study CARTITUDE-1 ([NCT03548207](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03548207)) ciltacabtagene autoleucel safety and efficacy of were evaluated in 97 patients with r/r multiple myeloma who presented disease progression post their last chemotherapy regimen; 82% of the patients had received four or more prior lines of antimyeloma therapy. The dosage of ciltacabtagene autoleucel given to patients was falling within the range of 0.5–1.0 × 106 viable CAR-positive T-cells/kg body weight. According to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, the efficacy was evaluated by an Independent Review committee based on the overall ORR and DOR response. The ORR 97.9%, and a median DOR of 21.8 and 12 months median duration of follow up. Most commonly observed adverse reactions of ciltacabtagene autoleucel were CRS, fatigue, hypogammaglobulinemia, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, infection, diarrhea, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, headache, vomiting, and constipation. Moreover, recommended dosage of (CARVYKTI™) ranges from 0.5–1.0 × 106 to a maximum dose of 1 × 108 viable CAR-positive T-cells/kg of body weight per single infusion. The approval of (CARVYKTI™) is restricted by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy necessitating healthcare facilities that houses this therapy and their associated clinicians to be specially certified to recognize and manage neurotoxicity and CRS. FDA called for a post-marketing observational study conducted by the manufacturer involving the patients treated with ciltacabtagene autoleucel ([Berdeja et al., 2021](#B20)).\n\n## 7 Limitations and Solutions for CAR T-Cells\n\nThe CAR T-cell technology has immense potential. Current clinically approved CAR T-cell therapies are KYMRIAH™ for ALL and DLBCL; YESCARTA™ for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; TECARTUS™ for mantle cell lymphoma; BREYANZI® for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; and ABECMA® for MM. Unfortunately, all these approved CAR-T cell products exert serious but clinically manageable adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity ([Zhao Z. et al., 2018](#B357); [Zheng et al., 2018](#B360)). Notably, the delay in approving CAR T-cell therapies targeting other diseases has the following structural limitations.\n\n### 7.1 Tumor Antigen Escape\n\nSingle antigen-targeting CAR-T cells might face tumor resistance after the initial high response rate. The decline in response and increase in resistance is due to partial or complete loss of target antigen expression. Tumor cells escape killing by encouraging mutations in the antigen-coding gene, leading to the downregulation of expression of alternative antigens that lack the antigen epitopes targeted by CAR T-cells ([Majzner and Mackall, 2018](#B188); [Sterner and Sterner, 2021](#B276)). One strategy to overcome this hurdle is to design T cells equipped with two or more CARs to target multiple TAAs, suggesting that the escape mechanism would require mutation of several genes instead of one by engineering CARs with multi-specific targets such as bicistronic CAR T-cells, tandem CAR T-cells, co-administered CAR T-cells, or co-transduction CAR T-cells. However, finding more than one TAA in one tumor targeted by CAR T-cells may prove challenging in some malignancies, with respect to safety and effectiveness ([Hegde et al., 2013](#B108); [Jackson and Brentjens, 2015](#B122)). In addition, the use of lymphodepleting agents before the adoptive T-cell transfer can enhance epitope spreading, leading to more specific antigen recognition ([Cui et al., 2009](#B56)). Additionally, combining CAR T-cell therapy with checkpoint inhibitors ([Gargett et al., 2016](#B83); [Li et al., 2017b](#B171); [Heczey et al., 2017](#B106); [Adusumilli et al., 2021](#B6)), radiation ([Weiss et al., 2018](#B321)), vaccines ([Slaney et al., 2017](#B266); [Tanaka et al., 2017](#B286)), other immune agonists ([Khalil et al., 2016](#B141); [Majzner et al., 2017](#B187)) might also contribute to epitope spreading and immune escape restriction ([Majzner and Mackall, 2018](#B188)).\n\n### 7.2 On-Target Off-Tumor\n\nOne of the most observed toxicities in CAR T-cell therapy is the “on-target-off-tumor,” where the normal tissues express the same targeted antigen on the malignant tissues at variable levels, leading to a direct attack from CAR T-cells against the normal tissues and eventually resulting in toxic effects that can be detrimental ([Sun et al., 2018](#B280)). To overcome this roadblock, using affinity-tune CARs to recognize tumor cells that have increased density of surface antigens and preventing the involvement with normal tissues that express low-density surface antigens has been suggested ([Zhao et al., 2009](#B356)). This strategy can be executed by altering the binding region of scFV via mutagenesis or via the recombination of both heavy and light chains ([Carter et al., 1992](#B36); [Drent et al., 2017](#B66)). Another potential avenue for solid tumors is to target tumor-restricted post-translational modifications, such as overexpression of truncated O-glycans such as Tn (GalNAca1-O-Ser/Thr) and sialyl-Tn (STn) (NeuAca2–6-GalNAca1-O-Ser/Thr) ([Steentoft et al., 2018](#B275)). Another suggested approach is CAR T-cell local administration to the disease site, which might contribute to the limitation of “on-target-off-tumor” toxicity as the on-target activity is focused on the malignant tissue, and the normal tissue interaction is disregarded ([Sterner and Sterner, 2021](#B276)). Inducible CAR-T cell products based on engineered synthetic Notch receptors are also being explored to mitigate the on-target off-tumor associated toxicities ([Roybal et al., 2016](#B246)).\n\n### 7.3 Trafficking and Tumor Infiltration\n\nOne of the significant inadequacies in using CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumors is the ability of these cells to traffic and infiltrate the tumor because both immunosuppressive TME and physical barriers of tumor such as stroma restrain mobility and diffusion of CAR T-cells. The proposed approach uses the local administration as the delivery route, which disregards the need for the cells to traffic to the disease site ([Sterner and Sterner, 2021](#B276)). Another strategy developed to overcome the trafficking issue is the addition of chemokine receptor expression on CAR T-cells that match and respond to chemokines expressed by targeted tumors ([Whilding et al., 2019](#B323)). The physical barrier of the stroma mainly comprises an extracellular matrix with a primary component of heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Upon its degradation, CAR T-cells can reach the tumor ([Zhang B.-L. et al., 2016](#B345)). Engineered CAR T-cells with heparinase expression have been shown to degrade HSPG, leading to enhanced tumor infiltration and elimination ([Caruana et al., 2015](#B37)). Likewise, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) was also targeted by CAR T-cells in animal models, which increased cytotoxic function by reducing the number of tumor fibroblasts ([Wang et al., 2014](#B311)).\n\n### 7.4 Immunosuppressive Microenvironment\n\nIn the TME, several tumor-infiltrating cells contribute to immunosuppression, including MDSCs, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) ([Quail and Joyce, 2013](#B234)). These infiltrates and tumor cells contribute to the production of tumor-supporting growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines, and the antitumor immunity declines because of immune checkpoint proteins such as CTLA-4 or PD-1. Weak CAR T-cell responses could be regarded as a poor T-cell expansion and limited persistence period, indicating that the development of T-cell exhaustion is prompted by co-inhibitory pathways ([Yin et al., 2018](#B341)). Consequently, the combination of CAR-T cells with immunotherapy and checkpoint blockade is thought to be the next cutting-edge immunotherapy approach because it provides two major elements to secure strong immune responses: CAR T-cells provide tumor penetration and PD-1/PDL1 blockade to guarantee sustained and persistent T-cell function ([June et al., 2018](#B135); [Grosser et al., 2019](#B95)). Recently, CAR-T cells have been engineered to be robustly resistant to TME immunosuppressive factors such as TFG-β-mediated inhibitory signals ([Kloss et al., 2018](#B149)). Furthermore, CAR T-cell engineering includes the addition of immunostimulatory signals such as stimulatory cytokines capable of increasing survival, proliferation, and antitumor activity while re-equalizing TME ([Chmielewski et al., 2014](#B50)). Various studies have been investigating numerous cytokines to create “armored CARs.” The studies that focused on proinflammatory cytokines apart from concentrating on inhibitory signals have depended on IL-12 secretion ([Koneru et al., 2015](#B154)), expression of IL-15 ([Krenciute et al., 2017](#B155)), and the redirection of immunosuppressive cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-4) towards proinflammatory cytokines ([Mohammed et al., 2017](#B203)).\n\n### 7.5 CAR T-Cell-Associated Toxicities\n\nT-cell therapy has been one of the most groundbreaking tools in cancer treatment; however, toxicities and associated fatalities have limited this approach’s applications. To date, the characterization of the toxicities associated with CAR T-cell therapy has been broadly studied in patients receiving FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapy such as anti-CD19 CARs ([Sterner and Sterner, 2021](#B276)). Several factors determine the occurrence and intensity of (CRS), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome-like activation (MAS-L) (HLH/MASL), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), including tumor type, specific target, and CAR design ([Roex et al., 2020](#B243)).\n\nThe most frequent acute toxicity associated with CAR T-cell therapy is the CRS; the cytokines involved are produced either by the infused CAR T-cells or by the CAR T-cell-responding immune cells such as macrophages. These cytokines include TNF-α, several interleukins such as IL-6, IL-2, -IL-2α, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-γ, which were elevated in the patient’s serum. Also, patients with severe CRS experience high-grade pyrexia, which can develop into an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response with circulatory shock requiring vasopressors, vascular leakage, disseminated vascular clots, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and multi-organ system dysfunction. The severity of the CRS was correlated with the type of cytokines detected in the serum ([Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016](#B26); [Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2018](#B264)). Organ dysfunction can be reversed in most patients once CRS signs are recognized and managed early ([Morris et al., 2021](#B206)). Management of CRS using supportive care includes antipyretics, blood components transfusion, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab) used against the IL-6 receptor, and steroids in high-grade CRS. Both tocilizumab and steroids can control CRS in most cases. However, resistant CRS can also develop where the symptoms persist regardless of supportive treatments in a minority of patients, putting them at a high mortality risk ([Yang X. et al., 2019](#B336)).\n\nICANS is another common toxicity occurring after CAR T-cell infusion and is associated with treatment-related morbidity. However, the exact mechanism underlying the manifestation of neurologic toxicity remains indistinct. CAR T-cell facilitated inflammation-causing endothelial activation and disruption of the blood-brain barrier may play a central role ([Holtzman et al., 2021](#B115)). ICANS manifestation begins with toxic encephalopathy, aphasia, dysphasia, impaired motor function, and drowsiness. In severe cases, more severe symptoms occur, such as seizures, motor weakness, cerebral edema, and coma, most patients experiencing ICANS had earlier CRS that had subsided. Therefore, CRS could be considered an early sign of ICANS. Concurrence between ICANS and CRS occurs less frequently. ICANS is also reversible in patients who do not develop permanent neurological deficits ([Morris et al., 2021](#B206)). Management of ICANS aims to reduce the inflammatory response, which could be achieved by using Siltuximab (IL-6 antagonist), which prevents continuous IL-6 translocation across the blood-brain barrier ([Gust et al., 2017](#B99)). A high dose of corticosteroids shows sound central nervous system (CNS) penetration ([Neelapu et al., 2017b](#B214)). The use of levetiracetam or other antiepileptic agents can also be considered an option for treating severe neurological dysfunction as prophylaxis for seizures ([Pehlivan et al., 2018](#B224)). Additional studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying ICANS manifestation, associated risk factors, and optimal management required for CAR-T cell infusion.\n\nHLH is a rare condition characterized by fever, hyperferritinema, splenomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, coagulopathy, and cytopenia due to improper immune activation and cytokine release ([Risma and Jordan, 2012a](#B240)). In patients with low-grade CRS, HLH can occur; however, severe CRS might evolve into HLH. Thus, clinicians must pay attention to this condition to prevent fatal outcomes HLH/MAS post CAR T-cell therapy in association with CAR T-cell induced toxicities (CARTOX) score, which includes serum ferritin levels >10.000 ng/ml and one of the following: oliguria grade ≥3 or elevated serum creatinine grade ≥3, pulmonary edema, elevation in serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase grade ≥3, and incidence of hemophagocytosis bone marrow ([Mei et al., 2018](#B199)). Management of HLH/MAS as mentioned in CRS and ICANS with anti-IL-6 agents and corticosteroids can be used. However, if the condition persists for almost 48 h, other interventions, such as intrathecal cytarabine and etoposide, especially in neurotoxicity-associated HLH ([Neelapu et al., 2017b](#B214)).\n\nSeveral recommendations have been proposed to attenuate the toxicities resulting from CAR T-cells: 1) to ensure that the therapeutic efficacy is valid and no toxic overshooting of cytokines is occurring by monitoring the CAR T-cell activation threshold post-infusion. Activation of CAR T-cells is influenced by several factors, including tumor antigen expression levels on malignant cells, the affinity of the antigen-binding domain to target epitope, tumor burden, costimulatory elements of CARs ([van der Stegen et al., 2015](#B301); [Milone and Bhoj, 2018](#B201)); 2) to achieve low affinity of the antigen-binding domain to ensure selectivity for tumors with high expression levels of targeted antigen; 3) hinge-region and transmembrane region modifications and optimization to control cytokine secretion levels and keep them within the therapeutic window as seen in anti-CD19 CAR T-cells where no CRS or ICANS were observed ([Ying et al., 2019](#B342)); 4) costimulatory domain can be customized based on tumor burden, tumor antigen binding domain engagement, antigen density, and toxicity concerns. Evidence suggests that 4-1BB costimulatory domains show lower toxicity risk, lower T-cell expansion levels, higher T-cell endurance. In contrast, CD28 costimulatory domains are associated with CAR T-cell onset rapid activation and consequent exhaustion. These properties make 4-1BB domains more preferable in cases of high disease burden or/and high tumor antigen density, and in cases of low surface antigen density or/and low-affinity antigen-binding domain CARs with CD28 costimulatory domains are more preferable ([Salter et al., 2018](#B250)); 5) CARs immunogenicity can be decreased by modifying hinge region and/or transmembrane domain, which also contributes to CAR T-cell persistence improvement ([Jonnalagadda et al., 2015](#B133); [Sommermeyer et al., 2017](#B269)); 6) neutralization of GM-CSF to overcome CRS and neurotoxicity, tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition by metyrosine or deletion of this enzyme in a myeloid cell-specific manner resulted in catecholamine and cytokine levels reduction ([Staedtke et al., 2018](#B274)), use of IL-1 antagonists to reduce neuroinflammation ([Giavridis et al., 2018](#B87)); 7) use of “off-switch” or suicide gene strategies to encourage selective elimination of CAR T-cells at the commencement of adverse events under a secondary agent control. However, the slow onset of antibody-mediated depletion limits the efficacy of this approach, especially in patients who require immediate reversal during acute and severe cytokine toxicities; therefore, faster switches such as inducible cas9 were developed and proved to deplete 90% of CAR T-cells within 30 min ([Di Stasi et al., 2011](#B64); [Jones et al., 2014](#B131)). Engineering CAR T-cells with CD20 full-length expression or CD 20 mimotopes, which deplete CAR T-cells post rituximab treatment ([Philip et al., 2014](#B225)), use of switch off CARs (SWIFF-CARs) ([Juillerat et al., 2019](#B134)). The most significant limitation in utilizing the suicide gene strategy is the sudden cessation of therapy in rapidly progressing diseases, making this strategy a last resort. However, recently, the use of TKIs, which inhibit proximal TCR signaling kinases and suppress T cell activation (dasatinib), provide temporary inhibition of CAR T-cells. CAR T-cell activity would resume after toxicity has subsided ([Sterner and Sterner, 2021](#B276)). Additional studies are required to overcome all toxicities without affecting the activity and persistence of CAR-T cells.\n\n### 7.6 Autologous Vs. Allogeneic\n\nAlthough most of the clinical studies testing CAR T-cells depended on autologous T-cells, these therapies presented several limitations. The patient’s cell generation is a cost-time-consuming process that holds a risk of manufacturing failure ([Zhao J. et al., 2018](#B350)). Additionally, it might result in a delayed availability of treatment, which could be problematic for patients with aggressive and highly proliferative diseases ([Depil et al., 2020](#B63)). The patients usually receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which might affect the quality and quantity of the starting autologous T cells ([Ceppi et al., 2018](#B39)); in contrast, allogeneic CAR-cells (derived from healthy donors) offer fully functional cells in high amounts allowing multiple generations of “off-the-shelf” CAR T cells products ([Zhao J. et al., 2018](#B350); [Depil et al., 2020](#B63)). The heterogenic nature of tumor cell antigen expression and the immune evasion mechanisms developed by tumor cells require CAR T-cells with multiple antigen specificities ([Walsh et al., 2019](#B305)). This issue could be overcome by allogeneic T-cells capable of generating several CAR T-cells products with various antigen specifiers (multivalent), unlike autologous T-cells that are known to be capable of generating (monovalent) CAR T-cells ([Martínez Bedoya et al., 2021](#B194)). Allogeneic CAR T-cells can be obtained from several sources such as mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors that are capable of providing high numbers of fitter cells than the ones derived from the patients’ blood as they have been subjected to radio- or chemotherapy ([Depil et al., 2020](#B63)). Umbilical cord blood is another source. Furthermore, adult somatic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be produced by introducing specific transcription factors ([Papapetrou, 2016](#B221)) ([Figure 2](#F2)). Despite the advantages of allogeneic CAR T-cells, some limitations prevent their use in the CAR T-cells field. The first limitation is the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the allo-rejection produced by the host immune cells, which would hinder the cells’ anti-tumor activity ([Martínez Bedoya et al., 2021](#B194)). Changes within the design of the allogeneic CAR T-cells could overcome the GVHD; these changes include the employment of genetic engineering tools such as Zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and CRISPR/Cas9, which can be utilized in knocking-out T-cell receptor (TCR) and in attenuating the GVHD. Strategies to mitigate allorejection are being evaluated; chemo-resistant CAR T-cells are also being repeatedly tested through several rounds of administration to allow more profound or prolonged lymphopenia ([Poirot et al., 2015](#B228); [Valton et al., 2015](#B300)). Overcoming the limitations of both autologous and allogeneic CAR T-cells is a great challenge but not impossible in such a fast-growing field.\n\n## 8 Conclusion\n\nThe employment of adaptive immunity in treating chronic and malignant diseases has been the focus of many studies over the past few decades. The CAR T-cell revolution has changed the landscape of conventional therapies used in cancer and has provided new opportunities to test these technologies against other diseases. However, CAR T-cell therapy has few limitations, slowing its widespread clinical application as a routine treatment. To overcome these limitations, various *in vivo* and *in vitro* studies have suggested innovative strategies to enhance the efficacy of CARs against blood cancers and solid tumors. Several factors have been designated as necessary in CAR T-cell design, including tumor antigen expression levels on malignant cells, the affinity of the antigen-binding domain to the target epitope, tumor burden, and costimulatory elements of CARs. However, there is still a need to elucidate and resolve the issues associated with this intriguing technology. Therefore, further development of eccentric strategies to reduce CAR T-cell therapy limitations while maintaining antitumor efficacy, cellular persistence, and expansion will be necessary to magnify the clinical applications of this therapy. Notably, “off-the-shelf” CAR-T cell products with CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited changes to manage toxicities and persistence will hold much promise. Additionally, the utilization of synthetic biology and cell engineering technologies might break the barriers impeding allogeneic CAR T-cells from being used as universal CAR T-cells, which could be pivotal in enhancing therapeutic outcomes and overall patient survival.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Taif University and King Faisal Medical Complex (KFMC) for their contributions and facilitation during the research.

However, a notable number of patients with DLBCL fail to achieve remission after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and may therefore require a dual targeted CAR T-cell therapy. A 31-year-old man with refractory DLBCL was assessed in the present case report. The patient was treated with sequential infusion of single CD19 CAR T cells followed by dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T cells. The outcome was that the patient achieved partial remission after the first single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion and complete remission after the dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell infusion. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed after the single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion, while grade 3 CRS and hemophagocytic syndrome were observed after the dual targeted CAR T-cell infusion, but these adverse effects alleviated after the treatments. To the best of our knowledge, the present case report is the first to describe the successful application of dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of refractory DLBCL. The report suggests that dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy may represent a promising option for the treatment of refractory DLBCL; however, caution should be taken due to potential CRS development.\n\n**Keywords:** diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chimeric antigen receptor T cell, cytokine release syndrome, therapy, CD19, CD22\n\n## Introduction\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma worldwide with the morbidity frequently in elderly people ([1](#b1-ol-0-0-11882)). DLBCL is an aggressive malignancy of large transformed B-lymphocytes that often originates from the lymph nodes, and that exhibits a notable molecular heterogeneity in gene profiles and clinical outcomes ([2](#b2-ol-0-0-11882)). DLBCL is potentially curable. Patients with DLBCL at an early stage usually undergo a short course of chemotherapy consisting of four drugs (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) known as CHOP, or chemo-immunotherapy, which is a combination of chemotherapy and the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan®) ([3](#b3-ol-0-0-11882)). For patients with late-stage DLBCL with a higher risk of recurrence after treatment, high-dose chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant is provided as an option ([2](#b2-ol-0-0-11882)). Allogeneic transplantation from a sibling or matched unrelated donor may be considered for patients with refractory disease, early relapse or relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation ([4](#b4-ol-0-0-11882)). All these therapeutic strategies have greatly improved the survival time of patients with DLBCL ([5](#b5-ol-0-0-11882)). Although DLBCL can now be successfully treated in ~50% of patients, certain individuals, especially those with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, fail to respond to these conventional treatments or to achieve long-term outcomes ([2](#b2-ol-0-0-11882)).\n\nA number of novel therapies or procedures are being tested in various clinical trials for DLBCL, including immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors ([6](#b6-ol-0-0-11882)). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is one of the most promising immunotherapies for patients with DLBCL ([7](#b7-ol-0-0-11882)). As of December 10, 2019, [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) has registered a total of 896 CAR T-cell-associated clinical trials worldwide, including 43 for DLBCL. There are currently 15 clinical trials being performed in China for DLBC, including one using CD19- and CD22-targeted sequential treatment ([8](#b8-ol-0-0-11882)), nine against CD19 ([9](#b9-ol-0-0-11882)), two against CD22, two against CD20 and one against CD19/22 ([10](#b10-ol-0-0-11882)). The principle of CAR T-cell therapy is to genetically modify autologous T cells with a recombinant receptor construct composed of an antibody-derived extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to intracellular T-cell signaling domains of the T-cell receptor. The T cell-antigen interaction is independent from molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, and is therefore not regulated by the immune escape promoted by tumor cells ([11](#b11-ol-0-0-11882)). Choosing the right tumor antigen as a target is the key to designing safe and effective CAR T-cell therapies. B-cell malignancies commonly express the surface antigens CD19 and CD22, which are not expressed on other non-B cells (such as hematopoietic stem cells) ([12](#b12-ol-0-0-11882)). At present, CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is widely used in clinical trials of malignant B-cell tumors, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly for aggressive B-cell lymphomas ([13](#b13-ol-0-0-11882)). Single- and multi-center clinical trials using anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy have demonstrated the effectiveness of this cell therapy, it has great efficacy and long-term remissions in patients with poor-risk DLBCL, when no other effective treatment options are available ([14](#b14-ol-0-0-11882)). With no other effective treatment options available, the single and multi-center clinical trials have demonstrated that the anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy can provide long-term remission in patients with poor-risk DLBCL ([15](#b15-ol-0-0-11882),[16](#b16-ol-0-0-11882)). As a synergistic targeting strategy, compared with targeting a single antigen, dual specific CD19- and CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy may represent a potential approach to improve the outcomes in patients with DLBCL with heterogeneous expression of CD19 and CD22 on leukemic blasts ([16](#b16-ol-0-0-11882)).\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered after infusion of antibody-based therapies, such as CAR T-cell therapy. According to the ZUMA-1 (Yescarta®) trial data published in January 2019, 83% of the 101 patients with assessable efficacy achieved an objective response and 58% achieved a complete response ([14](#b14-ol-0-0-11882)). Among the 108 patients whose safety could be assessed, 48% developed grade ≥3 serious adverse events and 11% of patients exhibited grade ≥3 CRS ([17](#b17-ol-0-0-11882)). CRS represents one of the most frequent serious adverse effects and is one of the challenges of using bispecific antibody (such as CD19/CD22) CAR T-cell therapies ([18](#b18-ol-0-0-11882)–[20](#b20-ol-0-0-11882)). To the best of our knowledge, the present case report describes the first clinical case of a patient with refractory DLBCL who underwent both single CD19- and dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapies after multi-line chemotherapy regimens, and who achieved complete remission (CR) with minor CRS-associated adverse events.\n\n## Case report\n\nA 31-year-old man with no prior medical history presented with persistent epigastric pain for 1 week was admitted to the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University on April 3rd, 2015. Imaging scans demonstrated a large mass-like conglomerate in the abdomen, with the maximum clast length measuring up to 13 cm ([Fig. 1A](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)). After that, immunohistochemistry examination of the biopsy specimen was performed as described below. Formalin-fixed (at 4°C for 24 h) and paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 5 µm thick sections. After drying at 65°C for 2 h, tissues were deparaffinized and hydrated in graded alcohol and PBS. The sections were blocked at room temperature with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity for 5 min. EDTA pre-incubated with 5% normal bovine serum (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Ltd.) was applied for antigen retrieval at room temperature for 20 min. Sections were subsequently incubated with antibodies against CD20 (cat. no. IS60430-2; 1:200; Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc.), CD19 (cat. no. 551520; 1:100; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), CD22 (cat. no. 563941; 1:100; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), CD10 (cat. no. 561002; 1:1; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), BCL2 (cat. no. IS61430-2; 1:10; Agilent Technologies, Inc) and BCL6 (cat. no. 1306055; 1:75; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), overnight at 4°C. The sections were subsequently incubated with secondary antibody (cat. no. KIT-5220; 1:200; Maxim Biotech, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction products were treated with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin at room temperature for 5–10 min. Tissue sections were observed under a light microscope (magnification, ×20). The results of immunohistochemistry stains revealed the infiltration of large atypical pleomorphic lymphoid cells, which expressed CD20, CD19, CD22 and BCL2, but not BCL6 and CD10. Furthermore, >70 and >50% of cells were positive for Ki-67 and c-Myc staining, respectively. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a shadow in the right upper lobe of the lung ([Fig. 1B](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)), while pathology tests of CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy revealed epithelioid granulomas. The purified protein derivative skin test was negative, while a more accurate T cell-based test of tuberculosis infection was positive, indicating a prior mycobacteria infection ([21](#b21-ol-0-0-11882)). According to Ann Arbor staging system ([22](#b22-ol-0-0-11882)), the patient who diagnosed with DLBCL was classified as stage I after the biopsy procedure and immunohistochemical analysis. This type of DLBCL was also characterized as a non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) subtype ([23](#b23-ol-0-0-11882)). Due to the age of the patient, the international prognostic index was evaluated as 2 ([2](#b2-ol-0-0-11882)), and due to the persistent residual mass in the abdomen, the patient was considered to be at high-intermediate risk. The flow diagram of the treatments used is presented in [Fig. 2](#f2-ol-0-0-11882).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/dbc077e6398a/ol-20-04-11882-g00.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7405542_ol-20-04-11882-g00.jpg)\n\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/dbc077e6398a/ol-20-04-11882-g00.jpg)\n\nAxial images of CT chest and abdomen scan after two rounds of CAR-T infusion.

(A) Record of patient's progress after single CD19 CAR-T infusion or CD19 + CD22 CAR-T infusion treatment. Blood was collected from the patient, and conditioning chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophoamide was conducted, following by giving either CD19 CAR-T infusion or CD19+CD22 CAR-T infusion treatment; the grade of CRS, PR or pseudoprogression and CR or relapse were recorded. (B) Clinical protocol design with time frame ranged from −30 days to 5 years. 4 weeks before the treatment, patient had screening, pre-evaluation and signed ICF, followed by detection and documentation the size of tumor burden before conditioning chemotherapy. One month after the infusion, any side effects and short-term effects were observed and assessed. At the conclusion of the CAR-T cell monitoring, the patient was asked for long-term follow up (2–5 years). CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; PR, partial remission; CR, complete remission; CRS, cytokine release; ICF, informed consent form; D, day; M, month; Y, years.\n\nThe patient only achieved partial remission after two cycles of standard therapy, including 750 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide, 1.4 mg/m2 of vincristine (max dose of 2 mg), 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, 100 mg of prednisone, and 375 mg/m2 of rituximab (R-CHOP). After that, an intensified immunochemotherapy regimen therapy was applied, as shown by cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m2, vincristine 2 mg/m2 (max dose of 2 mg), doxorubicin 75 mg/m2, prednisone 60 mg, and rituximab 375 mg/m2 (R-ACVBP). The patient finally achieved CR after two courses of the R-ACVBP regimen, followed by another two courses of chemotherapy for consolidation. At 2 months post-CR, imaging scans revealed that the abdominal mass was ~7.6×5.1 cm in size ([Fig. 1C](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)), which was considered as a recurrence. The patient received sequential salvage chemotherapies, including two cycles of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, two cycles of rituximab and lenalidomide, one cycle of gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin, and one cycle of etoposide, methyl prednisolone, cisplatin and cytarabine. Despite many attempts at treatment, the patient with refractory DLBCL exhibited no significant response to the salvage therapies.\n\nInstead of stem cell transplantation, the patient received radiotherapy at a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions in order to treat the retroperitoneal soft-tissue masses. Although the tumor burden decreased ([Fig. 1D](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)), the course of radiotherapy was interrupted due to the development of severe bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal intolerance. As one of the most common acute side effects of radiation therapy, a reduction of T cells was observed in the peripheral blood of the patient, and the biopsy of the abdominal mass resulted positive for CD19 expression in the non-GCB subtype DLBCL. Additionally, full-body CT scans revealed enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes located in the abdomen, as compared with prior CT scans ([Fig. 1E](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)).\n\nThe CAR construct used in the present study was composed of a CD19-scFv (FMC63), the costimulatory domains of 4-1BB and the endodomain of CD3-θ ([24](#b24-ol-0-0-11882),[25](#b25-ol-0-0-11882)). After careful physical examination, the patient was recruited for a CD19 CAR T-cell therapy clinical trial ([NCT03121625](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03121625)). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (100 ml) were collected to prepare CD19-directed CAR T cells. A lymphodepleting pretreatment (25 mg/m2 fludarabine on days-4 to −2, and 900 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide on days-2 to −1) was administered prior to a 2×106 cells/kg CAR T-cell infusion on day 0. Within 12 h after infusion, the patient developed grade 1 CRS with fever ([26](#b26-ol-0-0-11882)). On day 28 post-infusion, the patient exhibited partial remission. An imaging test revealed that the size of the enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen was decreased ([Fig. 1F](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)).\n\nAt 4 months post-infusion, the patient experienced disease progression, assessed via imaging examination revealing enlarged lymph nodes (maximum diameter, 4.89 cm; [Fig. 1G](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)). Immunohistochemistry results from the biopsy demonstrated that the infiltrates around the abdominal mass were CD19 and CD22 double-positive cells. Therefore, a dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy with the same dose of the FC regimen (fludarabine, 25 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 250 mg/m2) was administered to the patient 150 days after the first CD19 infusion. Imaging before the second CART treatment showed that the abdominal mass was significantly larger than before ([Fig. 1H](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)). The patient received 2×106/kg of both CAR T cells on day 0. The patient developed grade 3 CRS with shivering, hypotension and hyperpyrexia, and therefore received anti-infection and rehydration treatments. Full body CT scans on day 23 revealed that the abdominal mass had increased in size (maximum diameter, 9 cm), suggesting a poorer prognosis ([Fig. 1I](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)). Accordingly, the patient had persistent fever for >1 week, with pancytopenia, a decreased fibrinogen level (<1.5 g/l; normal range, 2–4 g/l) and an elevated serum ferritin level (23,410.00 ng/ml; normal range, 15–200 ng/ml for adult male). The proliferation of peripheral blood CAR T cells was analyzed via quantitative (q)PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reversed transcribed into cDNA using the reverse transcription kit (cat. no. 18091050; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). cDNA was amplified using EmeraldAmp® PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The algorithm 2−ΔΔCq method ([27](#b27-ol-0-0-11882)) was used to normalize the relative expression of genes to GAPDH. The following primer sequences were used for qPCR: CAR forward, 5′-CATCCTCCCTGTCTGCCTCT-3;′ and reverse, 5′-GCCTCCGCCATCTTATCTTT-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-TGCATTCGCCCTCTTAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CATCACGCCACAGTTTCC−3′; and CAR FQ-PCR forward, 5′-GGATTCGCCAGCCTCCAC−3′ and reverse, 5′-AAACTTGGCTCTTGGAGTTGT−3′. CAR FQ-PCR-Probe: 5′-(FAM)-TCCCAGCCACTCCAGACCCTT-(MGB)-3′. Additionally, qPCR was carried out with an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The following thermocycling conditions were applied: 1 cycle at 50°C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, while 60°C for 60 s ([27](#b27-ol-0-0-11882)). The data demonstrated that both CD19 and CD19/CD22 CAR T cells began to expand after 4 days, peaked on days 7 and 18, and then gradually decreased ([Fig. 3A-C](#f3-ol-0-0-11882)). Notably, dual-CAR T cells were mixed after individual transduction, and their expansion was ~5 times higher than single CD19 CAR T cells; additionally, both CD19+ and CD22+ CAR T cells remained sustained at higher levels for 2 further months. After infusion of both CAR T cells, the patient exhibited an intermittent high fever during the first few days but, subsequently, the body temperature gradually returned to normal and remained stable ([Fig. 3D and E](#f3-ol-0-0-11882)). The levels of lymphocytes, ferritin and C-reactive protein gradually decreased after day 7 for CD19 single CAR T-cell infusion ([Fig. 4A](#f4-ol-0-0-11882)), and for dual CAR T-cell infusion, the level of platelets drastically decreased after day 18, while the levels of ferritin and C reactive protein decreased after day 20 ([Fig. 5A](#f5-ol-0-0-11882)). Although no immediate infusion-associated toxic effect was observed, a febrile syndrome with elevated cytokine levels was subsequently observed after CAR T-cell infusions ([Figs. 4B](#f4-ol-0-0-11882) and [5B](#f5-ol-0-0-11882)). Overall, the present results indicated that the patient developed grade 1 CRS after single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion, and grade 3 CRS after dual CAR T-cell infusion.\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/eeb68c7e9ce6/ol-20-04-11882-g02.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7405542_ol-20-04-11882-g02.jpg)\n\n![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/eeb68c7e9ce6/ol-20-04-11882-g02.jpg)\n\nMonitoring of circulating T-cell subsets and body temperature after CAR T-cell infusion.

The patient was treated with dexamethasone (20 mg/day), which was later replaced by methylprednisolone (80 mg/day) on day 33. The body temperature of the patient was well controlled from day 48. Additionally, the patient developed gastrointestinal bleeding and was therefore administered proton pump inhibitors, intravenous fluids and electrolytes, while the oral intake of liquids or solids was prohibited. There was a marked reduction in the size of the abdominal mass after day 54 ([Fig. 1J](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)). The hemophagocytosis symptom was not observed after day 57, while at the same time several blood tests, including ferritin levels and coagulation function, returned to normal. A full-body CT scan on day 72 demonstrated CR ([Fig. 1K](#f1-ol-0-0-11882)) that continued until day 100. Flow cytometric analysis ([28](#b28-ol-0-0-11882)) revealed that most of the lymphocytes before infusion were CD3+ and CD3+/CD4+ T cells, and these cells were replaced by CAR T cells rapidly after infusion ([Fig. 6](#f6-ol-0-0-11882)). The proportion of CAR T cells increased and then decreased within 1-month post-infusion for single CAR T-cell infusion but remained high in dual CAR T-cell infusion for at least 2 months. Overall, the present data suggest a synergistic efficacy of CD19- and CD22-targeted CAR T cells in the present patient. After monitoring (up to D60) and infecting with H1N1 (at D85), the patient was transferred to the Hebei Provincial Chest Hospital because of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\n\n### Figure 6.\n\n[![Figure 6.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/69db769d8232/ol-20-04-11882-g05.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7405542_ol-20-04-11882-g05.jpg)\n\n![Figure 6.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/69db769d8232/ol-20-04-11882-g05.jpg)\n\nMonitoring of lymphocyte subsets after CAR T-cell infusion.

At present, >800 CAR T-cell studies are registered on [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov), with one-third being CD19-targeted CAR T-cell trials. Tumor cells of B-cell malignancies typically express both CD19 and CD22 surface antigens ([30](#b30-ol-0-0-11882)), making dual targeted CAR T cells a more broadly active therapy ([31](#b31-ol-0-0-11882)). To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the efficacy of dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy in DLBCL. In addition, the toxicity and safety have not yet been investigated. The present case report describes the first clinical experience in a patient with DLBCL treated with bispecific CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T cells.\n\nSingle-agent MOR208 therapy has previously demonstrated a good clinical performance in patients with relapse/refractory (r/r) DLBCL and r/r follicular lymphoma, including in patients refractory to rituximab ([32](#b32-ol-0-0-11882)). A number of published reports have identified CD19 as a promising target for CAR T-cell therapy for most B-cell malignancies, including ALL ([33](#b33-ol-0-0-11882)–[35](#b35-ol-0-0-11882)). The peak of CAR T-cell expansion was positively correlated with post-treatment efficiency and survival time, in accordance with previous studies ([36](#b36-ol-0-0-11882),[37](#b37-ol-0-0-11882)). Due to the short duration and small number of CD19 CAR T-cell expansions, the patient in the present case report only reached partial remission for 3 months.\n\nAlthough most B-cell ALL cases can be targeted by CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, 5–10% of relapses occur in patients with absent or low cell-surface expression of CD19 ([38](#b38-ol-0-0-11882),[39](#b39-ol-0-0-11882)). In the PLAT-02 clinical trial, 93% of patients with r/r ALL exhibited a good response after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy; however, 50% of patients relapsed at the end of the trial ([40](#b40-ol-0-0-11882)). Instead of CD19 expression, CD22 expression was identified in patients with relapsed leukemia. The Stanford University School of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute have launched a phase I clinical trial of anti-CD22 CAR T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed B-cell ALL and obtained significant progress. This includes CD-22 CAR that can mediate similar potent antineoplastic effects as CD19, while the dual CD19/CD22 targeted immunotherapeutic plays an important role to overcome the resistance to immunotherapy via antigen loss ([41](#b41-ol-0-0-11882)). In November 2019, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China) published a single case report of HBV reactivation after sequential treatment with CD19 and CD22 in a patient with DLBCL; after 2.5 months of CAR T-cell treatment, the tumor condition remained stable and superficial lymph nodes could not be detected ([42](#b42-ol-0-0-11882)). In the present report, the proportion of CAR T cells remained high throughout the two CAR T-cell infusions, and gradually restored the body temperature of the patient to normal, thereafter remaining stable. Therefore, the synergistic efficacy of CD19 and CD22 CAR T-cell infusion was observed in the present patient with refractory DLBCL.\n\nThe dose of CAR T-cell infusion is dependent on body weight. Due to the different weight of patients, the total number of CAR T cells returned to each individual is not the same, making it difficult to analyze all patients by a specific number of CAR T cells and therefore having to rely on CAR T-cell expansion trends and patient symptoms as a marker of treatment efficacy. In the present report, the CAR T cells began to expand on days 4–7, peaked on days 7–10 and began to decline on day 14. CRS is one of the most notable adverse reactions in the clinical application of CAR T-cell technology ([43](#b43-ol-0-0-11882),[44](#b44-ol-0-0-11882)). If patients experience severe CRS reactions, such as high fever, >20% blood pressure reduction, dyspnea and grade 4 organ damage, the test should be automatically suspended, and restorative treatment should be initiated immediately. In the present report, due to the large release of cytokines caused by T-cell expansion, the patient developed manageable CRS symptoms, such as fever, hypotension, myalgia and respiratory failure. Currently, although there are drugs that can control CRS, complications remain a barrier to standard treatment. It has been demonstrated that the degree of CRS severity is associated with disease burden at the time of infusion, as a higher tumor burden results in more serious CRS ([45](#b45-ol-0-0-11882)), suggesting that in the case of low tumor burden, such as early disease, the risk and severity of CRS in patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy may be markedly reduced. Therefore, in the present study, radiotherapy was used prior to CAR T-cell therapy, successfully decreasing the tumor burden of the patient. It has been suggested that CRS is over-activated by immune effector cells, resulting in excessive release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ([46](#b46-ol-0-0-11882)). Therefore, the associations between the number of CAR T-cell expansions and IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were analyzed in the present report. The analysis revealed that when the patient was infused with a single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion for the first time, the qPCR amplification curve and the fold-change curve of IL-6 seemed to have the same trend, suggesting that there was no association between qPCR and the changes in the three factors (IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α). However, upon further analysis of the three cytokines and qPCR via one-way ANOVA, no statistical differences were observed (P>0.2), indicating that it may be due to insufficient sample size. IL-6 is a cytokine known to cause side effects, such as fever, hypotension, myalgia and respiratory failure ([46](#b46-ol-0-0-11882)). In addition to T cells, macrophages are a typical cell subset that produce IL-6 ([47](#b47-ol-0-0-11882)). In a mouse model, the severity of CRS was reduced when monocytes depleted, which provided the major source of IL-1 and IL-6 or can block IL-6 receptor with tociizumab, suggesting that IL-6 inhibitors or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies may reverse the syndrome ([48](#b48-ol-0-0-11882)). Recently, two independent trials from two research teams at the San Rafael Institute of Science and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) demonstrated that CRS is triggered by the inflammatory molecule IL-1 ([46](#b46-ol-0-0-11882),[47](#b47-ol-0-0-11882)). Anakinra is an IL-1 inhibitor that can be combined with CAR T-cell therapy and is effective in managing CRS and neurotoxicity ([49](#b49-ol-0-0-11882)). In addition, researchers from the MSKCC have designed CAR T cells that secrete an IL-1 inhibitor to prevent CRS.\n\nThe present case report demonstrates the efficacy and safety of dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy in the treatment of DLBCL. The present results provide evidence that dual CAR T-cell therapy may be a promising option for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL in patients who do not benefit from single CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. However, CRS is the major adverse effect of dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy and caution should be taken for patients receiving this treatment. However, this was only one case report on a single patient; therefore, the optimal dose of CAR T cells and the follow-up treatment remain to be clarified in well-designed studies with larger sample sizes.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Funding\n\nNo funding was received.\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n## Authors' contributions\n\nCH designed the experiments and wrote the article.

However, a notable number of patients with DLBCL fail to achieve remission after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and may therefore require a dual targeted CAR T-cell therapy. A 31-year-old man with refractory DLBCL was assessed in the present case report. The patient was treated with sequential infusion of single CD19 CAR T cells followed by dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T cells. The outcome was that the patient achieved partial remission after the first single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion and complete remission after the dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell infusion. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed after the single CD19 CAR T-cell infusion, while grade 3 CRS and hemophagocytic syndrome were observed after the dual targeted CAR T-cell infusion, but these adverse effects alleviated after the treatments. To the best of our knowledge, the present case report is the first to describe the successful application of dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of refractory DLBCL. The report suggests that dual CD19/CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy may represent a promising option for the treatment of refractory DLBCL; however, caution should be taken due to potential CRS development.\n\n**Keywords:**\nCD19; CD22; chimeric antigen receptor T cell; cytokine release syndrome; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; therapy.\n\nCopyright: © Huang et al.\n\n[PubMed Disclaimer](/disclaimer/)\n\n## Figures\n\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/3c6aa7fda6ba/ol-20-04-11882-g00.gif)\n\nFigure 1.\n\nAxial images of CT chest…\n\nFigure 1.\n\nAxial images of CT chest and abdomen scan after two rounds of CAR-T…\n\n![Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d8d2/7405542/055270c9a747/ol-20-04-11882-g01.gif)\n\nFigure 2.\n\nSchematic representation of the patient's…\n\nFigure 2.\n\nSchematic representation of the patient's progress and clinical protocol design.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing therein, including approval by the Avalon stockholders pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), Avalon agreed to purchase (the “Acquisition”) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Sen Lang (the “Sen Lang Shares”).\n\nSen Lang, through a “variable interest entity” structure (described in more detail below under “VIE Structure”) of contractual rights held by its wholly-owned subsidiary Beijing Langlang Runfeng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign owned enterprise with limited liability organized and existing under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) (the “PRC Subsidiary”), has full economic benefit and management control over, and is consolidated for accounting purposes with, Senlang Biotechnology Co. Ltd., a PRC domestic company with limited liability organized and existing under the laws of the PRC (the “OpCo” or “SenlangBio”). The OpCo is mainly engaged in the business of research and development in relation to CAR-T cell therapy, immune cell therapy and related drug development. The OpCo is owned 100% by certain of the Sen Lang Beneficial Shareholders. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the OpCo, Shijiazhuang Senlang Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd., a company with limited liability organized and existing under the laws of the PRC (“SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory”) is engaged in the business of testing of immunology, serology and molecular genetics specialties for patients, including hematology-tumor diagnostics and testing prior to clinical trials for cell therapy. The business of the OpCo and SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory is described in more detail below under Item 8.01 – Other Events.\n\nPrior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Board of Directors of Avalon (the “Board”), unanimously (i) determined that the terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, (iii) authorized, empowered and directed the Company to perform all of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and related documents, and (iv) resolved to recommend the adoption of the Purchase Agreement by the stockholders of the Company in compliance with the rules of Nasdaq (the “Company Board Recommendation”).\n\nThe purchase price being paid by Avalon to the Sen Lang Shareholders under the Purchase Agreement for the Sen Lang Shares is an aggregate of 81 million shares (the “Acquisition Shares”) of the common stock, par value US$0.0001 per share, of Avalon (the “Avalon Common Stock”). Ten percent (10%), or 8.1 million, of such shares will be held in escrow for 12 months following the closing to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the Sen Lang Shareholders under the Share Purchase Agreement. In addition, at the closing of the Acquisition, it is expected that Dr. Jianqiang Li, scientific founder and CSO of the OpCo, will join the board of the Company, and Dr. Li will also be appointed as Chief Technology Officer of the Company. The Acquisition Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and, therefore, will be restricted securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act for six months or longer after the closing of the Acquisition, subject to “affiliate” status with the Company under the Securities Act.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the parties thereto, including covenants relating to obtaining the requisite approvals of the stockholders of Avalon and Sen Lang, regulatory approvals and Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s conduct of their respective businesses (and that of the OpCo) between the date of signing of the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Acquisition.\n\nIn addition, Sen Lang and its affiliates agreed not to (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any person relating to the acquisition of the equity or assets of Sen Lang, its subsidiaries and the OpCo and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Acquired Companies”) or (ii) enter into or renew any distribution agreement related to the business of the Acquired Companies, in each case without the prior written consent of Avalon.\n\n1\n\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Avalon will prepare and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a proxy statement and will seek the approval of its stockholders with respect to certain actions, including the following:\n\n●the issuance of the Acquisition Shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the approval of the potential issuance of the securities of Avalon in the Equity Financing (as defined below) under the rules of the Nasdaq;and\n\n●any other proposals to be determined as necessary by Avalon and Sen Lang.\n\n**VIE Structure**\n\nAs a part of the Acquired Companies’ restructure before the closing of the Acquisition, the OpCo and SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory will be controlled by the PRC Subsidiary by entering into a series of variable interest entities agreements among the PRC Subsidiary, the OpCo and all current shareholders of the OpCo, as well as the Investor (as defined below) (such agreements are collectively referred to as the “VIE Agreements”, and such contractual control arrangement is referred to as the “VIE Structure”).\n\nIn the PRC, the VIE structure has become a popular and widely used overseas listing mode for enterprises in the sectors which are foreign investment restricted or prohibited, like the development and application of genetic diagnosis and treatment technology, which includes the OpCo’s business. The VIE structure refers to an agreement mode in which the PRC domestic operating entity is separated from the overseas-listed entity, and the overseas-listed party/holding company controls the domestic operating entity by signing relevant agreements with the parties who would otherwise receive the benefits of ownership of the OpCo and control its operations (i.e., VIE Agreements), and is able to consolidate the financial statements of the PRC domestic operating entity into the overseas-listed entity/holding company. After the completion of the overall VIE Structure, the interests/profits from the domestic operation, as well as operational control, have been transferred to the overseas listing/holding company.\n\nIt is a condition to closing under the Purchase Agreement that the OpCo, the PRC Subsidiary and the shareholders of the OpCo (including the Investor in the Equity Financing described below under “Equity Financing”) execute the VIE Agreements. These VIE Agreements include (i) an exclusive technical consultation and service agreement; (ii) an exclusive purchase option agreement; (iii) an entrustment agreement of shareholders’ rights; (iv) a share pledge agreement; and (v) a spouse consent letter.\n\n**Conditions to Closing**\n\n_General Conditions_\n\nConsummation of the Acquisition is conditioned on, among other things, (i) the absence of any order, stay, judgment or decree by any government agency making the Acquisition illegal or otherwise preventing the Acquisition; (ii) Avalon receiving necessary approvals from its stockholders for the Acquisition and the Exchange Shares under the rules of Nasdaq, and (iii) the additional listing application for the Acquisition Shares and the Exchange Shares being approved by Nasdaq.\n\n_Avalon’s Conditions to Closing_\n\nThe obligations of Avalon to consummate the Acquisition, in addition to the conditions described above in the first paragraph of this section, are conditioned upon each of the following, among other things:\n\n●the representations and warranties of the Acquired Companies being true on and as of the closing date of the acquisition and the Acquired Companies complying with all required covenants in the Purchase Agreement;\n\n●there having been no material adverse effect to the Acquired Companies’ business;\n\n●the Equity Financing shall have been consummated no later than concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition; and\n\n●the VIE Agreements shall have been executed and delivered.\n\n2\n\n_Sen Lang and Affiliates’ Conditions to Closing_\n\nThe obligations of the Sen Lang Owners and Sen Lang to consummate the Acquisition, in addition to the conditions described above, are conditioned upon each of the following, among other things:\n\n●Avalon complying with all of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement;\n\n●the representations and warranties of Avalon being true on and as of the closing date; and\n\n●there having been no material adverse effect to Avalon.\n\n**Termination**\n\nThe Purchase Agreement may be terminated and/or abandoned at any time prior to the closing, whether before or after approval of the proposals being presented to Avalon’s stockholders, under certain circumstances, including by:\n\n●the Sen Lang Representative if the Board of Directors of Avalon shall withdraw, modify or change the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Sen Lang Owners;\n\n●either Avalon or the Sen Lang Representative if at the Avalon Annual Meeting (as defined above) the requisite vote of Avalon’s stockholders to authorize the issuance of the Acquisition Shares in the Acquisition in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq shall not have been obtained; and\n\n●either Avalon or the Sen Lang Representative if the closing has not occurred by December 31, 2021 (the “Outside Date”.\n\n**Indemnification**\n\nThe Sen Lang Owners agreed to indemnify Avalon and its affiliates from any damages arising from any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and covenants of Sen Lang and the Sen Lang Owners contained in the Purchase Agreement or from the VIE Agreements not being found valid or enforceable. The indemnification obligations are capped at the value of approximately 8,100,000 of the Acquisition Shares that will be held in escrow, except for claims related to fraud and certain fundamental representations, in which case the obligations are capped at the amount of the Acquisition Shares actually paid by Avalon to the indemnifying party.\n\nThe foregoing summary of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.\n\n_Equity Financing_\n\nIn connection with the Acquisition, on June 13, 2021, an institutional investor (the “Investor”) entered into an agreement with the OpCo related to the purchase of registered capital of the OpCo (the “OpCo Capital Increase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Investor will acquire an aggregate of up to 15.6% of the equity ownership of the OpCo for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$30,000,000 (the “Equity Financing”), which funds will be invested in the OpCo in three equal installments of US$10,000,000, at a fixed price, the first to be upon the closing of the Acquisition, the second to be within three months after the closing and the third to be within six months after the closing. In addition, pursuant to a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Sen Lang, the OpCo and the Investor, dated June 13, 2021, the Investor has the right, exercisable between the six-month and five year-anniversaries of the respective initial closing and installment closings, to elect to exchange, from time to time, all or part of its then-owned equity ownership of the OpCo for shares (the “Exchange Shares”) of Avalon Common Stock at a fixed exchange price of US$1.21 per share of Avalon Common Stock, which was the market price of the Avalon Common Stock as of the date of the Exchange Agreement under Nasdaq rules. In addition, the Exchange Agreement provides that the Investor may only exchange up to 10% of its total investment amount in any 30 day period.\n\n3\n\nThe foregoing summary of the Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.\n\nChina eCapital Holdings, Ltd. (CEC Capital) served as financial advisor to Avalon in connection with the Equity Financing and will receive a cash fee of approximately $900,000, representing 3% of the gross proceeds from the Equity Financing.\n\n**Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities**\n\nThe information with respect to the Acquisition and the Equity Financing, including the Purchase Agreement and the Exchange Agreement, is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference. The Acquisition Shares and the Exchange Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, and instead will be issued pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.\n\n**Item 8.01 Other Events**\n\n_Business of the Acquired Companies_\n\n**Overview**\n\nSenlangBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that focuses on three advanced technology platforms—CAR T-cells, CAR γδT-cells and armTILs—to develop a robust pipeline of innovative and transformative cellular immunotherapies for cancer patients. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells (CAR-T) are natural cell-killing T-cells that have been engineered to specifically recognize and kill cancerous cells. Allogeneic (universal) CAR γδT-cells (CAR-GDT) are a specific class of donor-derived T-cells that can provide superior anti-tumor effectiveness. Armored tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (armTILs) are cancer-killing T-cells that provide a unique “personalized” cellular immunotherapy approach.\n\nSenlangBio is currently the largest cell therapy company in Northern China in terms of the scale of bio-manufacturing, as well as the breadth and depth of active pre-clinical research and clinical development programs.\n\nSenlangBio is currently gathering clinical trial data through in-human “investigator-initiated” clinical trials, which are conducted by SenlangBio in cooperation with several hospitals in China. To date, over 300 patients have received 15 of SenlangBio’s cellular immunotherapies through these early-stage clinical studies at 13 hospitals and medical centers, covering 9 medical indications. Such clinical trials have been designed to fully comply with the same requirements applicable to clinical trials registered with China’s National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), in particular the requirements related to manufacturing quality control, informed consent, data integrity, data management, and GCP requirements.\n\nSenlangBio was formed in 2016 in Hebei Province, China. The principal executive offices of SenlangBio are located at Room 512 and 513, Building 1, 136 Yellow River Avenue, Shijiazhuang High-tech Development Zone, Hebei Province, China, and its telephone number is +86-311-82970975.\n\n4\n\n**Drug Candidate Pipeline**\n\n_Candidates in the Clinical (Investigator Initiated) Development Stage:_\n\n●**Senl_1904B:**Autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL);\n\n●**Senl_B19:**Autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T for R/R non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL);\n\n●**Senl_H19:**Autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T for post CAR-T relapsed B-ALL and NHL;\n\n●**Senl_NS7CAR:**Autologous anti-CD7 CAR-T for T-cell ALL and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL);\n\n●**Senl_H19x22P:**Autologous, dual Anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CAR-T for R/R B-ALL and NHL\n\n_Candidates in the Preclinical/IND Enabling Stage:_\n\n●**Senl_ABUCAR7:**Universal anti-CD7 CAR-T for R/R T-ALL and T-LBL;\n\n●**Senl_GDUCARxxx**(undisclosed target): Universal CAR-GDT for R/R acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS);\n\n●**Senl_GDSTCLDxx**(undisclosed target): Universal CAR-GDT for certain types of solid tumors;\n\n●**Senl_BCMA03:**Autologous, anti-BCMA CAR-T for R/R multiple myeloma (MM);\n\n●**Senl_comboCARs**(Senl_TAAx22P): Autologous, combo/customized anti-tumor associated antigen (TAA) and anti-CD22/PD-L1 CAR-T for sarcomas, ovarian cancer and other solid tumors;\n\n●**Senl_armTILs:**Autologous, “armored” tumor infiltrating lymphocytes for solid tumors\n\n**CAR-T Cell Therapy Platform**\n\nSenlangBio’s CAR-T cell therapy portfolio consists of multiple autologous and allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) candidates with single targets as well as “cocktail” combinations. Currently, SenlangBio’s autologous CAR-T candidates have demonstrated positive remission rates in early clinical studies against R/R B-ALL, T-cell ALL (T-ALL), NHL and T-LBL with a well-tolerated adverse effect profile.\n\n_Lead Clinical Candidates in Development_\n\n**Senl_1904B**, SenlangBio’s lead clinical stage candidate, is an autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T, in development for R/R B-ALL and NHL. This CAR-T design has the potential to reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS and CAR-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) frequent with the current first generation of CAR-T therapies yet retains robust anti-leukemia/lymphoma activities. Senl_1904B has demonstrated a 97.2% (35/36) complete remission rate and only a 5.6% (2/36) Grade 3 CRS among R/R B-ALL and NHL patients in a successfully completed principal investigator (PI)-initiated, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial. SenlangBio has recently received approval by the Chinese Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), a division of the NMPA, of the company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a new Phase I clinical trial in R/R B-ALL during 3Q2021.\n\n**Senl_NS7CAR**is an autologous anti-CD7 CAR-T candidate in development for R/R T-ALL and T-LBL. A successfully completed PI-initiated, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial demonstrated that 8 of 8 T-ALL and T-LBL patients achieved complete remission and none developed greater than Grade 2 CRS. SenlangBio plans to file an IND application with the CDE during 3Q2021 and will start an official Phase I clinical trial upon approval of the IND application.\n\n**Senl_H19x22P**is an autologous dual CAR-T candidate at the clinical development stage for R/R B-ALL and NHL. This CAR-T cell therapy candidate contains a cocktail of H19 CAR modified T cells and 22P CAR modified T cells. Generally, CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 has demonstrated promising success rates, however, a high rate of disease relapse remains a hurdle to overcome. An investigator-initiated trial demonstrated technical feasibility, high activity and low toxicities of the Senl_H19x22P CAR-T cell cocktail in treating B-ALL patients who relapsed after treatment with a CD19 CAR-T therapy containing murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv) (FMC63). So far, in a cohort of 7 patients who relapsed after FMC63-CAR therapy and were subsequently infused in an open-label trial with Senl_H19x22P CAR-T cocktails, 6 of them (85.7%) achieved MRD-negative complete remission (CR) within the first month of cell infusion. No patients developed CAR-T related serious (greater than grade-2) toxicities of CRS or CRES. SenlangBio plans to file an IND application with the CDE during 4Q2021 and will start an official Phase I clinical trial upon approval of the IND application.\n\n5\n\n**Select Candidates in Preclinical Development**\n\n_CAR-gdT cell-therapy candidates:_\n\n●Universal/allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) cell therapy modality\n\n●Potentially breakthrough treatment for relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\n\n●Targeting multiple solid tumor malignancies, including pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, sarcomas, and others\n\n●Successfully completed pre-clinical, IND-enabling stage and currently in preparation to initiate first-in-human clinical trials\n\n**Senl_comboCARs**are autologous CAR-T candidates customized in design with a combination of anti-tumor associated antigen (anti-TAA) CAR and anti-CD22/PD-L1 CAR. The gene construct is designed to simultaneously express two different CAR structures. The scFv of the first CAR structure can potentially recognize specific tumor-associated antigens, and the scFv of the second CAR structure can potentially target CD22. SenlangBio believes this strategy can enhance the proliferation of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood to ensure more CAR-T cells reaching the tumor locations. The CAR structure targeted to the tumor cell surface is designed to kill tumor cells. Additionally, the combinatorial CAR structure also includes a soluble scFv derived from an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, which is designed to overcome immunosuppression by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Based on the expression of different tumor associated antigens, scFv (TAA) can potentially be customized and replaced to target individual solid tumors. Currently, SenlangBio has designed and developed a series of comboCAR constructs consisting of individual and/or combinations of tumor-associated antigens which may potentially overcome the current shortage and limitation of CAR-T cell therapies for treatment of solid tumors.\n\n_CAR-GDT (CAR-γδT) Cell Therapy Platform_\n\nUniversal/allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) cell therapy modality and potentially breakthough therapy for difficult to treat R/R acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Therapeutic candidates are also targeting difficult to treat solid tumor malignancies, including pancreatic, gastric, and ovarian cancers as well as sarcomas, all of which represent a major unmet need among oncology patients. Several of the candidates have successfully completed the pre-clinical, IND-enabling stage, and SenlangBio is currently in preparation to initiate 3-4 PI-initiated first-in-human clinical trials targeting AML, MDS and solid tumors in 4Q2021.\n\n**SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory Business**\n\nSenlangBio Clinical Laboratory, a wholly owned subsidiary of SenlangBio that provides third-party clinical testing services, including 1) general biochemical, genomic and proteomic testing; and 2) cell therapy related testing such as hematology, immunology, cancer biomarkers, immuno-phenotyping, and others.\n\n**Strengths**\n\nBy leveraging unique core technology platforms and rapid research-to-clinical translation capabilities, SenlangBio seeks to develop a profile of cell therapy candidates with the following features of differentiating competence:\n\n●Diverse pipeline (“autologous” + “universal”) candidates with potentially potent and durable cancer-killing activities (hematologic + solid tumor malignancies)\n\n●High tolerability and established safety profile in clinical trials to date\n\n●Provide therapies for novel oncogenic indications that are unmet by the current generation of cellular immunotherapies\n\n●Accelerated research-to-clinical translation potentially enabling widespread patient accessibility and broader commercial adoption\n\n6\n\n**SenlangBio Management**\n\n**_Jianqiang Li, Ph.D._**_, Scientific Founder, CSO, Director_\n\nJianqiang Li has over 20 years of academic and industry experience in immunology and cell therapy.

Considering the CAR-T field, some notable competitors (in similar size and scale of business) include (but not limited to) Gracell Biotechnologies (NASDAQ: GRCL), Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ: LEGN), and Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PSTX). For CAR-gd T cell therapy field, some notable companies include (but not limited to) Adicet Bio Inc. (NASDAQ: ACET), Incysus Therapeutics, Inc and GammaDelta Therapeutics.\n\n**Employees**\n\nAs of February 28, 2021, SenlangBio had 104 employees, among which 85 employees work for SenlangBio and 19 employees work for SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory.\n\n**Government Regulation**\n\nCurrently, all of SenlangBio’s development work is being conducted in China. China has a dual-track regulatory pathway for conducting T-cell therapy clinical trials. The first track is approval for a health care-affiliated clinical study managed by the National Health Commission, China’s primary healthcare regulatory agency (the “NHC”) (the “IIT Pathway”). The other pathway is to register as a biological drug which requires an IND, a registered clinical trial and NDA approval by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), a subdivision of China’s National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) prior to commercialization (the “Drug Pathway”).\n\n7\n\n_1._ _IIT Pathway_\n\nIIT stands for investigator-initiated clinical trials, where such trials are initiated and conducted under the oversight of the NHC as a medical practice technology, rather than the NMPA as a medical product. The NMPA, generally speaking, will accept, review, and reject or approve an IND application only from the manufacturer of the investigational product as the sponsor of the IND, rather than from a physician who intends to be the investigator and sponsor of the IND. The NMPA distinguishes the former as a registered clinical trial (namely the clinical trial introduced in the section of “Drug Pathway”), and the latter as a non-registered clinical trial, and normally will not consider the data generated from investigator-initiated, non-registered clinical trials when it reviews the application for a registered clinical trial from the manufacturer.\n\nIn the case of CAR-T therapy, however, the NMPA is aware of the large number of investigator-initiated non-registered clinical trials in China and the United States, and some reviewers from the CDE have published two articles on its website in February 2018 and October 2018 expressing the view that (1) the mainstream regulatory oversight is to follow the pathway of registered clinical trials, but that (2) data from investigator-initiated non-registered clinical trials may be considered if the non-registered clinical trials otherwise fully comply with the same requirements applicable to registered clinical trials, in particular the requirements related to manufacturing quality control, informed consent, data integrity, data management, and all GCP requirements.\n\nIn March 2019, a Draft Somatic Cell Therapy Clinical Research and the Transformation Application Management Measures was released by the NHC, which stipulated, among others, that after filing with the NHC, hospitals may use somatic cell therapy treatment and charge patients. However, so far such measures do not come into effect, and any medical institutions or biotech companies which choose the IIT Pathway to conduct T-cell therapy shall be regulated as a clinical study within medical institutions and the IIT Pathway shall not be utilized for the purpose of commercialization.\n\nIn addition, sponsors taking the IIT Pathway need to complete the filing of the IIT with the competent NHC branch and obtain ethics review approval for the related clinical trials.\n\n_2._ _Drug Pathway_\n\nPursuant to PRC law, human cell therapy and its products are categorized as biological products and the application for biological products shall be submitted as part of the process of a new drug application.\n\nOn November 30, 2017, the NMPA promulgated the Notice of Guidelines for Acceptance and Examination of Drug Registration (Trial), which provides that the application for clinical trials of therapeutic biological products and the production and listing application for therapeutic biological products shall be subject to the provisions thereof. On December 18, 2017, the NMPA promulgated the Technical Guiding Principles for Research and Evaluation of Cell Therapy Products (Trial), which sets out the guidelines for medical study, non-clinical research and clinical research of cell therapy products.\n\nAs for the medical study of cell therapy, the general principle is that the medical studies and quality control of cell therapy shall take into account the fact that cells are capable of living in a body, multiplying and/or differentiating. At the same time, cell therapy products should meet the general requirements of drug quality management, and the whole production process of clinical samples should meet the basic principles and relevant requirements of the Good Manufacturing Practice for Drugs, or the GMP Regulations, published by the Ministry of Health on December 28, 1992 and further amended on January 17, 2011.\n\n8\n\nAccording to the Technical Guiding Principles for Cell Therapy Products, non-clinical research shall follow the following principles:\n\n(a)the research and evaluation of different products should follow the principle of a “case by case analysis” while at the same time, the Guidelines for the Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use should serve as a reference for the evaluation of non-clinical research of cell therapy products;\n\n(b)non-clinical study evaluation trials should use cell therapy products intended for clinical trials whenever possible. The production process and quality control of a subject used in a non-clinical trial shall be consistent with that of the subject to be used in a clinical trial (if not, the subject shall be explained and its effect on the prediction of human response shall be assessed);\n\n(c)non-clinical study evaluation should be conducted by selecting suitable species of animals whose biological response to cell therapy products is close to or similar to the expected human response. In some cases, alternatives to animal sources may also be used for evaluation;\n\n(d)in non-clinical study evaluation, the administration of cell therapy products should be able to maximize the simulation of the proposed clinical administration. If clinical administration cannot be simulated in animal studies, alternative administration methods should be identified in pre-clinical studies and their scientific and rational nature should be clarified; and\n\n(e)subject analysis data should be provided.\n\nAs for clinical trials, the Technical Guiding Principles for Cell Therapy Products stipulate that when cell therapy products enter clinical trials, they should follow the requirements of the GCP. In principle, the research contents of clinical trials should include a clinical safety evaluation, pharmacokinetics study, pharmacodynamics study, dose exploration study and confirmatory clinical trials. According to the product nature of different cell therapy products, the specific test design can be adjusted as appropriate.\n\nOn 13 March 2018, the CDE promulgated the Key Considerations in Applying for Clinical Trials of Cell Therapy Products for Pharmaceutical Research and Application Data to encourage the innovation of cell therapy products in view of the urgent need of such drugs. The document provides guidance on the preparation of pharmaceutical research and application materials in the application phase of clinical trials, according to which, on the basis of following the requirements of technical guidelines for carrying out relevant research, the applicant should pay special attention to certain considerations of pharmaceutical research and application materials, including production of raw materials, production process, quality studies, and stability studies. On the basis of the Technical Guiding Principles for Cell Therapy Products, on 18 October 2019, the CDE promulgated the Pharmaceutical Research Questions and Answers for Application of Cell Therapy Products for Clinical Trials (Issue One) to provide further reference for applicants on the common problems in the review and communication of IND application data of cell therapy products. On February 10, 2021, the CDE published the Technical Guidelines for Clinical Trials of Immunocell Therapy Products, the guidelines provide necessary technical guidance for the overall planning, design, implementation, and data analysis of cellular immune treatment (including CAR-T) products to carry out clinical trials, to reduce certain risks of the participating subjects in clinical trials and to regulate the evaluation method of the safety and effectiveness of such treatment. The guidelines are not mandatory.\n\nGiven the uniqueness of CAR-T and human cell therapies and that the regulatory pathway for such therapies is still evolving, standardization for CAR-T therapies is difficult to achieve and therefore approval would be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nSenlangBio currently protects its intellectual property and commercial exclusivity through a combination of Chinese patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyright. SenlangBio currently owns a total of ten Chinese patents (including two inventions and eight utility models) and five Chinese patents applications (including three invention applications and two utility model applications), as well as eight software copyrights and two trademarks. What follows is a summary of relevant intellectual property laws and principles in China.\n\n9\n\n(1)Patents\n\nPursuant to the PRC Patent Law, most recently amended in October 2020 (the amendment is implemented on June 1, 2021), and its implementation rules, most recently amended in January 2010, patents in China fall into three categories: invention, utility model and design. An invention patent is granted to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product or method or an improvement of a product or method. A utility model is granted to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure (or a combination of both) of a product. A design patent is granted to a new design of a certain product in shape, pattern (or a combination of both) and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the PRC Patent Law, the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years, and utility model and design patents are effective for ten years from the date of application. The PRC Patent Law adopts the principle of “first-to-file” system, which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who first files the application.\n\nExisting patents can be narrowed, invalidated or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity, and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. Under the PRC Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application.\n\nThe PRC Patent Law provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant (not limited to Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of China, must first submit it to the SIPO for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the relevant invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the SIPO has raised concerns by foreign companies that conduct research and development activities in China or outsource research and development activities to service providers in China.\n\n(2)Trade Secrets\n\nAccording to the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, the term “trade secrets” refers to technical and business information that is unknown to the public, has utility and may create business interests or profits for its legal owners or holders, and is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. Trade secret requirements under the current framework in China is still under development and not robust.\n\nUnder the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, which was promulgated on September 2, 1993 and was latest amended on April 23, 2019, business persons are prohibited from infringing others’ trade secrets by: (1) acquiring a trade secret from the right holder by theft, bribery, fraud, coercion, electronic intrusion, or any other illicit means; (2) disclosing, using, or allowing another person to use a trade secret acquired from the right holder by any means as specified in the item (1) above; (3) disclosing, using, or allowing another person to use a trade secret in its possession, in violation of its confidentiality obligation or the requirements of the right holder for keeping the trade secret confidential; (4) abetting a person, or tempting, or aiding a person into or in acquiring, disclosing, using, or allowing another person to use the trade secret of the right holder in violation of his or her non-disclosure obligation or the requirements of the right holder for keeping the trade secret confidential. If a third party knows or should have known that an employee or former employee of the right owner of trade secrets or any other entity or individual conducts any of the illegal acts listed above, but still accepts, publishes, uses or allows any other to use such secrets, this practice will be deemed as an infringement of trade secrets. A party whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may petition for administrative corrections, and regulatory authorities may stop any illegal activities and fine infringing parties in the amount of RMB100,000 to RMB1,000,000, and where the circumstance is serious, the fine will be RMB500,000 to RMB5,000,000. Alternatively, persons whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may file lawsuits in a Chinese court for loss and damages incurred due to the misappropriation.\n\n10\n\nThe measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written non-disclosure agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential.\n\n(3)Trademarks\n\nPursuant to the Trademark Law of the PRC promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on August 23, 1982 and last amended on April 23, 2019, which amendment became effective from November 1, 2019, the period of validity for a registered trademark is ten years, commencing from the date of registration. The registrant shall go through the formalities for renewal within twelve months prior to the expiry date of the trademark if continued use is intended. Where the registrant fails to do so, a grace period of six months may be granted. The validity period for each renewal of registration is ten years commencing from the day immediately after the expiry of the preceding period of validity for the trademark. In the absence of a renewal upon expiry, the registered trademark shall be canceled. Industrial and commercial administrative authorities have the authority to investigate any behavior in infringement of the exclusive right under a registered trademark in accordance with the law. In case of a suspected criminal offense, the case shall be timely referred to a judicial authority and decided according to the law.\n\n(4)Copyright\n\nPursuant to the Copyright Law of the PRC, effective in June 1, 1991 and most recently amended in November 2020 (the amendment was implemented on June 1, 2021), copyrights include personal rights such as the right of publication and that of attribution as well as property rights such as the rights of production and distribution. Reproducing, distributing, performing, projecting, broadcasting or compiling a work or communicating the same to the public via an information network without permission from the owner of the copyright therein, unless otherwise provided in the Copyright Law of the PRC, constitutes infringements of copyrights. The infringer must, according to the circumstances of the case, undertake to cease the infringement, take remedial action, and offer an apology or pay damages.\n\nPursuant to the Computer Software Copyright Protection Regulations promulgated on December 20, 2001 and last amended on January 30, 2013, a software copyright owner may complete registration formalities with a software registration authority recognized by the State Council’s copyright administrative department. A software copyright owner may authorize others to exercise that copyright, and is entitled to receive remuneration.\n\n_Risk Factors_\n\nPreliminary Note: references in this sub-section of this Item 8.01 to “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to SenlangBio and its subsidiaries.\n\n**Risks Related to SenlangBio’s Business**\n\n**_The NMPA may refuse to consider the data from the investigator-initiated clinical trials of SenlangBio due to concerns that (1) this does not follow the mainstream regulatory pathway of relying on registered clinical trials, or that (2) the non-registered clinical trials of the product may not otherwise fully comply with the same requirements applicable to registered clinical trials, as further explained below._**\n\nWhile investigator-initiated trials may provide us with clinical data that can inform our future development strategy, we do not have full control over the protocols, administration, or conduct of the trials. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with the way investigator-initiated trials are conducted, and there is no assurance the clinical data from any of our investigator-initiated clinical trials in China will be accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) or other comparable regulatory authorities outside of China, for any of our product candidates. Third parties in such investigator-initiated clinical trials may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with clinical trial protocols or applicable regulations. Further, any data integrity issues or patient safety issues arising out of any of these trials would be beyond our control, yet could adversely affect our reputation and damage the clinical and commercial prospects for our product candidates. Additional risks include difficulties or delays in communicating with investigators or administrators, procedural delays and other timing issues, and difficulties or differences in interpreting data. Third-party investigators may design clinical trials with clinical endpoints that are more difficult to achieve, or in other ways that increase the risk of negative clinical trial results compared to clinical trials that we may design on our own. As a result, our lack of control over the design, conduct and timing of, and communications with the FDA, NMPA, EMA and PMDA regarding investigator-initiated trials expose us to additional risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and the occurrence of which could adversely affect the prospects for our product candidates.\n\n11\n\nFurthermore, there is no assurance the clinical data from any of our investigator-initiated clinical trials in China, where the patients are predominately of Chinese descent, will produce similar results in patients of different races, ethnicities or those of non-Chinese descent.\n\n**_All material aspects of the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products in China are heavily regulated. Any failure to comply with existing regulations and industry standards, or any adverse actions by the NMPA or other comparable regulatory authorities against us, could negatively impact our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**\n\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the regulator’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, or total or partial suspension of production or distribution. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n**_Our preclinical programs may experience delays or may never advance to clinical trials, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize these product candidates on a timely basis or at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business._**\n\nOur product candidates are still in the preclinical development stage, and the risk of failure of preclinical programs is high. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies to obtain regulatory clearance to initiate human clinical trials. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the NMPA will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing and studies will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit IND applications for all of our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, and we cannot be sure that submission of IND applications will result in the NMPA allowing clinical trials to begin.\n\n**_Clinical trials are difficult to design and implement, involve uncertain outcomes and may not be successful._**\n\nHuman clinical trials are difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product candidate and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. As an organization, we have limited experience designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute clinical trials to support regulatory approval. There is a high failure rate for biologic products proceeding through clinical trials, which may be higher for our product candidates because they are based on new technology and engineered on a patient-by-patient basis. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Any such delays could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n12\n\n**_Success in preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials._**\n\nResults from preclinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. While we have received some positive data in previous preclinical and IIT trials, we are still in the process of producing and gathering more data and are still conducting more additional preclinical and IIT trials in order to seek regulatory approvals. For that reason, we do not know whether these candidates will be effective and safe for the intended indications in humans. Our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in further, registered clinical development despite positive results in preclinical and IIT studies. This failure to establish sufficient efficacy and safety could cause us to abandon clinical development of our product candidates.\n\n**_We depend on enrollment of patients in our clinical trials for our product candidates. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected._**\n\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with the protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\n●the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\n●the number of patients with the disease or condition being studied;\n\n●the understanding of risks and benefits of the product candidate in the trial;\n\n●clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating or drugs that may be used off-label for these indications;\n\n●the size and nature of the patient population who meet inclusion criteria;\n\n●the proximity of patients to study sites;\n\n●the design of the clinical trial;\n\n●clinical trial investigators’ ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\n●competing clinical trials for similar therapies or other new therapeutics not involving T cell-based immunotherapy;\n\n●our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\n●the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before completion of their treatment.\n\n13\n\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that may lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\n\n**_If the clinical trials of any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the NMPA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates._**\n\nWe may not commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate without obtaining marketing approval from the NMPA, and we may never receive such approvals. It is impossible to predict accurately when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans and will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each proposed indication. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of clinical development.\n\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events prior to, during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize any of our product candidates, including:\n\n●the NMPA may disagree as to the number, design or implementation of our clinical trials, or may not interpret the results from clinical trials as we do;\n\n●regulators may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\n●we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different clinical trial sites;\n\n●clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\n●we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\n●the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate or we may fail to recruit eligible patients to participate in a trial;\n\n●our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\n●regulators may issue a clinical hold, or regulators may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\n●the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\n●the NMPA may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\n14\n\n●the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\n●our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, particularly given their novel, first-in-human application, causing us or our investigators, or regulators to suspend or terminate the clinical trials; and\n\n●the approval policies or regulations of the NMPA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\n\nTo the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory for the NMPA to approve our new drug application, the commercialization of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\n\n**Risks Related to Intellectual Property**\n\n**_Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements._**\n\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and patent applications are due to be paid to the NIPA (National Intellectual Property Administration) in several stages over the lifetime of a patent. NIPA requires compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. Although an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment, loss of priority or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the PRC. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In any such event, our competitors or other third parties might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, result of operations and prospects.\n\n**_Changes in patent law could extend the expected expiry date of third party patents._**\n\nIn China, intellectual property laws are constantly evolving, with efforts being made to improve intellectual property protection in China. For example, an Amendment to the PRC Patent Law is implemented on June 1 2021 and proposed to introduce patent extensions to patents of new drugs that launched in the PRC. If adopted, patents owned by third parties may be extended, which may in turn affect our ability to commercialize our products without facing infringement risks. The adoption of this draft amendment may enable the patent owner to submit applications for a patent term extension. The length of any such extension is uncertain. If we are required to delay commercialization for an extended period of time, technological advances may develop and new products may be launched, which may in turn render our products non-competitive. We cannot guarantee that any other changes to PRC intellectual property laws would not have a negative impact on our intellectual property protection.\n\n**_Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats._**\n\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\n●others may be able to make products that are similar to any product candidates we may develop or utilize similar technology that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license now or in the future;\n\n15\n\n●we or any of our future licensors and collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or may license in the future;\n\n●we or any of our future licensors and collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\n●others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights;\n\n●it is possible that our pending owned or licensed patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\n●patents that we hold rights to or that may be issued from our pending patent applications may not provide us with a competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or third parties;\n\n●our competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in jurisdictions where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\n●we may obtain patents for certain inventions many years before we obtain marketing approval for products containing such compounds, and because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of our patents may be limited;\n\n●we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\n●the patents of others may harm our business; and\n\n●we may choose not to file a patent for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\n\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n**_Even if we are able to obtain patent protection for our product candidates, the life of such protection, if any, is limited, and third parties could be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products and technologies in a non-infringing manner, or develop and commercialize products and technologies similar or identical to ours and compete directly against us after the expiration of our patent rights, if any, and our ability to successfully commercialize any product or technology would be materially adversely affected._**\n\nThe life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. For example, in China, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its filing date. Even if we successfully obtain patent protection for an approved product candidate, it may face competition from generic or biosimilar medications. Manufacturers of generic or biosimilar drugs may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents in court or before a patent office, and we may not be successful in enforcing or defending those intellectual property rights and, as a result, may not be able to develop or market the relevant product exclusively, which would materially adversely affect any potential sales of that product.\n\n16\n\n**Risks Related to the VIE Structure and SenlangBio being a PRC Domestic Entity**\n\n**_The business of SenlangBio may fall into the prohibited foreign investment category under currently effective PRC laws._**\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the NPC promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced three existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the PRC Equity Joint Venture Law, the PRC Cooperative Joint VentureLaw and the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law grants foreign invested entities the same treatment as PRC domestic entities, except for those foreign invested entities that operate in industries deemed to be either “restricted” or “prohibited” in the “negative list” published by the State Council. Sen Lang is a BVI company and the PRC Subsidiary is currently considered to be a foreign invested entity.\n\nThe latest version of the “negative list,” namely, the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment (2019), which became effective on July 30, 2019, provides that foreign investment is prohibited in the development and application of genetic diagnosis and treatment technology. However, the PRC laws do not clarify the meaning of “development and application of genetic diagnosis and treatment technology” and do not explain whether transactions involving a VIE Structure should be considered as “investment” in the context of the prohibition of foreign investment. SenlangBio’s main business is conducting R&D and clinical transformation of immunotherapy cell therapy, which involves modifying the patient’s T-Cells genetically. Despite the foregoing lack of clarity, the applicable rules could be interpreted in a way unfavorable to the business of SenlangBio. First, in the context of law enforcement, if the competent PRC authorities and courts interpret “development and application of genetic diagnosis and treatment technology” broadly, the modification of T-Cells genetically could be considered as falling into the prohibited foreign investment category. Second, the newly implemented foreign investment law of China includes a catch-all definition of “foreign investment” that covers any other types of investment into China besides those listed in the law, which is generally believed as a strategy to leave room for the implementation of rules to address the VIE Structure. Therefore, the VIE Structure could be considered a violation of the applicable PRC laws.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is not contrary to Avalon and SenlangBio’s view that the parties are complying with PRC law. If SenlangBio’s CAR-T cell therapies or other technologies that are being researched and developed are deemed by relevant PRC regulatory agencies as falling into the category of “genetic diagnosis and treatment technology,” SenlangBio would be prohibited from engaging in the research or development of such technologies. In that event, Avalon and the Sen Lang Beneficial Shareholders would have to restructure Avalon’s control over SenlangBio. SenlangBio may also have to forfeit its income derived from the research and development of such technologies. Any of these occurrences may harm Avalon’s and SenlangBio’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly.\n\n**_The filing or change of the medical institution practice license of SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory may be affected by the VIE Structure._**\n\nAs SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory is a medical institution under the PRC laws, its operation is subject to the PRC regulation of foreign investment in the area of medical institution, which provides that a foreign investor can acquire 70% (to the highest extent) of the equity interests in a PRC medical institution. The relevant PRC laws also provide that the related government authority shall not approve any application of licenses/permits if the application is related to a company failing to comply with PRC foreign investment regulation.\n\nTherefore, if the competent PRC authority responsible for the registration of the medical institution practice license of SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory adopts a broad understanding of foreign investment rules that controlling via agreements can be deemed as a way of investment, the authority may disapprove SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory’s application in relation to its medical institution practice license, including any extension of such license. In the worst case, theoretically, the competent authorities may deem the VIE Agreements unenforceable because they are in violation of the PRC laws. In that event, SenlangBio Clinical Laboratory would not be qualified to conduct any business of testing of immunology, serology and molecular genetics specialties for patients, including hematology-tumor diagnostics and testing prior to clinical trials for cell therapy, which would result in the loss of the license and thereby the loss of income to SenlangBio from this business.\n\n17\n\n**Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Equity Financing**\n\n**_The amount of Acquisition Shares being issued to the Sen Lang Shareholders will not be adjusted in the event of any change in Avalon’s stock price._**\n\nThe aggregate number of Acquisition Shares being issued to the Sen Lang Shareholders fixed (other than minor adjustments due to fractional shares). Therefore, the total value of the Acquisition Shares will depend on the market price of the Avalon Common Stock at the closing of the Acquisition.\n\nThe market price of the Avalon Common Stock has fluctuated in the past, may fluctuate upon the announcement of the Purchase Agreement and may continue to fluctuate through the closing of the Acquisition and thereafter. The total market value of the Acquisition Shares to be issued at the closing will not be known until that time. Therefore, current and historical market prices of Avalon Common Stock may not reflect the value that the Sen Lang Shareholders will receive in the Acquisition, and the current stock price quotations for Avalon Common Stock may not provide meaningful information to Avalon stockholders. Avalon Common Stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AVCO.”\n\n**_Failure to complete the Acquisition could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Avalon._**\n\nThe parties’ respective obligations to complete the Acquisition are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement and described below. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Acquisition will be completed. If the Acquisition is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of Avalon may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Acquisition, Avalon would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n●Avalon may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the trading price of Avalon Common Stock, which could affect Avalon’s ability to secure sufficient financing in the future on attractive terms (or at all) as a standalone company, and from its customers, vendors, regulators and employees;\n\n●Avalon will be required to pay its expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition, whether or not the Acquisition is completed;\n\n●matters relating to the Acquisition (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Avalon management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Avalon otherwise.\n\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect Avalon’s business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\n\n**_The Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions and, if these conditions are not satisfied, the Purchase Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Acquisition may not be completed. In addition, the parties have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement under other specified circumstances, in which case the Acquisition would not be completed._**\n\nThe Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions and, if these conditions are not satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by law), the Acquisition will not be completed. These conditions include, among others: (i) the absence of certain legal impediments, (ii) obtaining all governmental authorizations, (iii) obtaining the Avalon stockholders’ approval, (iv) the consummation of the Equity Financing, (v) the execution of the VIE Agreements and (vi) the listing of the Acquisition Shares and the shares issuable pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Shares”) on Nasdaq. In addition, each party’s obligation to complete the Acquisition is subject to the accuracy of the other parties’ representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement (subject in most cases to “material adverse effect” qualifications), the other parties’ compliance, in all material respects, with their respective covenants and agreements in the Purchase Agreement.\n\n18\n\nThe conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Acquisition may not be completed. In addition, if the Acquisition is not completed by December 31, 2021, any party may choose not to proceed with the Acquisition. Moreover, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, before or after receipt of the Avalon stockholders’ approval and each party may elect to terminate the Purchase Agreement in certain other circumstances, as described in the Purchase Agreement.\n\n**_There can be no assurance that Avalon will be able to complete the Equity Financing._**\n\nIt is a condition to closing of the Acquisition that the Equity Financing shall have been consummated prior to or contemporaneously with the closing. The closing of the Equity Financing pursuant to the OpCo Capital Increase Agreement is subject to various conditions to closing, as well as the risk that the Investor does not abide by the terms of the OpCo Capital Increase Agreement. If the Equity Financing does not close for any reason, Avalon would need to waive or agree to amend the applicable condition to closing of the Acquisition. In addition, if the Equity Financing was not consummated and the Acquisition closed nevertheless, Avalon may not have sufficient capital for all planned expenses of the post-Acquisition company, and would likely need to raise additional capital. In such event, Avalon would likely seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of Avalon Common Stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict its operations, fund raising capabilities or otherwise. The source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our clinical development programs following the Acquisition. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us among other things, to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our planned clinical trials.\n\n**_Avalon may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition._**\n\nWhile Avalon will continue to operate as in the past until the completion of the Acquisition, the success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on Avalon’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits acquiring Sen Lang’s business. Avalon’s ability to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks, including, among others:\n\n●Avalon’s ability to successfully integrate the Sen Lang business;\n\n●the risk that Sen Lang’s business will not perform as expected;\n\n●the extent to which the parties will be able to realize the expected synergies, which include taking advantage of Sen Lang’s manufacturing and laboratory facilities and geographic location in Northern China;\n\n●the possibility that the aggregate consideration being paid for Sen Lang is greater than the value Avalon will derive from the Acquisition;\n\n●the reduction of cash available for operations and other uses;\n\n●the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Sen Lang; and\n\n●the possibility of costly litigation challenging the Acquisition.\n\n**_Integrating Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s businesses may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected._**\n\nAvalon and Sen Lang have operated and, until completion of the Acquisition will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or unexpected integration issues, such as higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Avalon and Sen Lang in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the business performs as expected include, among others:\n\n●combining the companies’ separate operational, financial, reporting and corporate functions;\n\n19\n\n●integrating the companies’ technologies, products and services;\n\n●identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\n●harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\n●addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\n●maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\n●attracting and recruiting prospective employees;\n\n●consolidating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\n●coordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts;\n\n●managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;\n\n●maintaining existing agreements with customers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and vendors;\n\n●coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and\n\n●effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\n\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of each company’s management and each company’s resources may be focused on completion of the Acquisition and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and, consequently, the business of the Company.\n\n**_Avalon and Sen Lang will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Acquisition is pending._**\n\nUncertainty about the effect of the Acquisition on employees, vendors and customers may have an adverse effect on Avalon or Sen Lang and consequently on us after the closing of the Acquisition. These uncertainties may impair Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers and others that deal with Avalon and Sen Lang, as applicable, to defer or decline entering into contracts with Avalon or Sen Lang, as applicable, or making other decisions concerning Avalon or Sen Lang, as applicable, or seek to change existing business relationships with Avalon or Sen Lang, as applicable. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the Acquisition, Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s businesses could be harmed. Furthermore, the Purchase Agreement places certain restrictions on the operation of Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s businesses prior to the closing of the Acquisition, which may delay or prevent Avalon and Sen Lang from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.\n\n**_Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with Avalon or Sen Lang._**\n\nEach of Avalon and Sen Lang has contracts with customers, vendors and other business partners which may require Avalon or Sen Lang, as applicable, to obtain consents from these other parties in connection with the Acquisition. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which Avalon and/or Sen Lang currently have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their relationships with either party in anticipation of the Acquisition, or with us following the Acquisition. The pursuit of such rights may result in Avalon and Sen Lang suffering a loss of potential future revenue, incurring liabilities in connection with a breach of such agreements or losing rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Acquisition or the termination of the Acquisition.\n\n**_Avalon or Sen Lang may waive one or more of the closing conditions to the Acquisition without re-soliciting stockholder approval._**\n\nEach of Avalon and Sen Lang has the right to waive certain of the closing conditions to the Acquisition. Any such waiver may not require re-solicitation of stockholders, in which case stockholders of Avalon will not have the chance to change their votes as a result of any such waiver and Avalon will have the ability to complete the Acquisition without seeking further stockholder approval. Any determination whether to waive any condition to the Acquisition, whether stockholder approval would be re-solicited as a result of any such waiver or whether the proxy statement would be amended as a result of any waiver will be made Avalon at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time, and any such waiver could have an adverse effect on us.\n\n20\n\n**_Avalon’s stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Acquisition and the Equity Financing and will exercise less influence over management._**\n\nAfter the completion of the Acquisition and the Equity Financing, Avalon’s stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the Company than they currently own. Upon completion of the Acquisition, it is expected that Avalon stockholders will own 51.0% of the total voting shares outstanding of Avalon, and the Sen Lang Shareholders will own 49.0% of the total voting shares outstanding of Avalon, in each case immediately after consummation of the Acquisition and not giving effect to the closing of the Equity Financing. As of the result of the Equity Financing and depending on the amount of shares of OpCo that the Investor elects to exchange for shares of Avalon Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the percentages set forth above will be reduced proportionately by the Exchange Shares. Consequently, Avalon stockholders, as a group, will have reduced ownership and voting power in us compared to their current ownership and voting power in Avalon and, therefore, will be able to exercise less collective influence over the management and policies of Avalon than they currently exercise.\n\n**_Executive officers and directors of Avalon may have interests in the Acquisition that are different from, or in addition to, the rights of Avalon stockholders._**\n\nExecutive officers of Avalon negotiated the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and the Avalon board of directors approved the Purchase Agreement and the Acquisition. These executive officers and directors may have interests in the Acquisition that are different from, or in addition to, the Avalon stockholders. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of Avalon following the Acquisition, the continued service of certain directors following the Acquisition and the indemnification of Avalon executive officers and directors by Avalon.\n\n**_Any issuance of Exchange Shares could cause dilution to then existing Avalon stockholders and may depress the market price of Avalon Common Stock._**\n\nUnder the Exchange Agreement, the Investor has the right, exercisable following the six month anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition and until the five year anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, to elect to exchange, from time to time, all or part of its equity ownership of the OpCo for Exchange Shares of Avalon at an effective exchange price of $1.21 per share of Avalon Common Stock. Following the completion of the financing and assuming the full funding by the investor in the financing, the aggregate number of shares of Avalon Common Stock that would be issuable under the Exchange Agreement (assuming the exchange of all shares) would be approximately 25,885,000 (assuming the current conversion rate of US dollars to RMB). The issuance of Exchange Shares could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of holders of Avalon Common Stock at the time of any exchanges.\n\n**_Avalon and Sen Lang may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the proposed Acquisition._**\n\nOur success after the Acquisition will depend in part on each of Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s ability to retain key executives and other employees. Uncertainty about the effect of the Acquisition on Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s employees may have an adverse effect on each company separately and consequently, the combined business. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Acquisition, as Avalon’s and Sen Lang’s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business.\n\n21\n\nFurthermore, if any of Avalon or Sen Lang’s key employees depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, Avalon or Sen Lang, as applicable, may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that Avalon or Sen Lang has been able to attract or retain employees in the past.\n\n**_Avalon and Sen Lang will incur significant transaction and Acquisition-related transition costs in connection with the Acquisition._**\n\nAvalon and Sen Lang expect that they will incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Acquisition and integrating the operations of the two companies post-closing. Avalon and/or Sen Lang may incur additional costs to retain key employees. Avalon and/or Sen Lang will also incur significant fees and expenses relating to financing arrangements and legal services (including any costs that would be incurred in defending against any potential class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits in connection with the Acquisition if any such proceedings are brought), accounting and other fees and costs, associated with consummating the Acquisition. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the Acquisition is completed. Though Avalon and Sen Lang continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Acquisition and the integration of the businesses of Avalon and Sen Lang.\n\n**_The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K is preliminary and our actual financial position or results of operations after the Acquisition may differ materially._**\n\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the Acquisition been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon estimates, to allocate the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated acquisition-date fair values. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and a final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Sen Lang that existed as of the date of the completion of the Acquisition. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma information reflected in this Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\n**_Avalon may be the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed._**\n\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Avalon’s liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Acquisition, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed, which may adversely affect Avalon’s business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n**_The lack of a public market for Sen Lang shares makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of the Sen Lang shares, and Avalon may pay more than the fair market value of the Sen Lang shares._**\n\nSen Lang is privately held and its share capital is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine Sen Lang’s fair market value. Because the percentage of Avalon’s equity to be issued to the Sen Lang Shareholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that Avalon may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for Sen Lang.\n\n22\n\n_Transactions with Related Parties_\n\nOn April 10, 2020, SenlangBio entered into a scientific research project cooperation agreement with Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital Co., Ltd., under which Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital Co., Ltd. conducts scientific research for the interest of SenlangBio on the cytoplasmic CD79a antibody gated multicolor flow cytometry monitoring CD19-CAR-T bridging allogeneic transplantation for the treatment of refractory and relapsed acute B lymphocytic leukemia. SenlangBio provides the research funds in the amount of RMB 2 million to Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital Co., Ltd. Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital Co., Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of an entity whose chairman is Wenzhao Lu, the Chairman and largest shareholder of Avalon.\n\n_Press Release_\n\nOn June 14, 2021, Avalon announced the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the Exchange Agreement. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Additional Information about the Proposed Acquisition Transaction and Where to Find It**\n\nThis communication relates to the proposed Acquisition and may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition, Avalon will file relevant materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the “Proxy Statement”). This communication is not a substitute for the Proxy Statement or for any other document that Avalon may file with the SEC or send to Avalon’s stockholders in connection with the Acquisition. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF AVALON ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AVALON, THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, THE ACQUISITION AND RELATED MATTERS. The Acquisition will be submitted to Avalon’s stockholders for their consideration. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the Proxy Statement (when available) and other documents filed by Avalon with the SEC through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Copies of the documents filed by Avalon with the SEC will also be available free of charge on Avalon’s website at www.avalon-globocare.com or by contacting Avalon’s Investor Relations contact at PR@Avalon-GloboCare.com.\n\n**Participants in the Solicitation**\n\nAvalon and its directors and certain of its executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Avalon’s stockholders with respect to the Acquisition under the rules of the SEC. Information about the directors and executive officers of Avalon and their ownership of shares of Avalon’s common stock is set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021 and in subsequent documents filed with the SEC, including the Proxy Statement. Additional information regarding the persons who may be deemed participants in the proxy solicitations and a description of their direct and indirect interests in the Acquisition, by security holdings or otherwise, will also be included in the Proxy Statement and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC when they become available. You may obtain free copies of this document as described above.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Avalon generally identifies forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar words. These statements are only predictions. Avalon has based these forward-looking statements largely on its then-current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond Avalon’s control. Avalon’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) risks associated with Avalon’s ability to obtain the stockholder approval required to consummate the Acquisition in accordance with Nasdaq rules and the timing of the closing of the Acquisition, including the risks that a condition to closing would not be satisfied within the expected timeframe or at all or that the closing of the Acquisition will not occur; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Purchase Agreement; (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the Purchase Agreement, (iv) unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Acquisition, the response of business partners and competitors to the announcement of the Acquisition; and (v) those risks detailed in Avalon’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC, as well as other documents that may be filed by Avalon from time to time with the SEC. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Avalon cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this communication relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, Avalon undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\n23\n\n**Item 9.01****Financial Statements and Exhibits.**\n\n(d) Exhibits.\n\n**Exhibit\n\n Number****Description**\n2.1*[Share Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2021, among Avalon GloboCare Corp, Lonlon Biotech Ltd., the Sen Lang Shareholders and the Sen Lang Representative.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1630212/000121390021032225/ea142642ex2-1_avalonglobo.htm)\n10.1[Securities Exchange Agreement, dated June 13, 2021, among Avalon GloboCare Corp, Lonlon Biotech Ltd., Senlang Biotechnology Co.
