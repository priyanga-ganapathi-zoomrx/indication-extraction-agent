This change may or may not be caused by the intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Age or age group\n\nA type of eligibility criteria that indicates the age a person must be to participate in a clinical study. This may be indicated by a specific age or the following age groups:\nThe age groups are:\n\n    *   Child (birth-17)\n    *   Adult (18-64)\n    *   Older Adult (65+)\n\n*   All-cause mortality A measure of all deaths, due to any cause, that occur during a clinical study. \n*   Allocation A method used to assign participants to an arm of a clinical study. The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized. \n*   Arm A group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment, or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol. \n*   Arm type A general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm, active comparator arm, placebo comparator arm, sham comparator arm, and no intervention arm. \n*   Baseline characteristics Data collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment). \n*   Canceled submission Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator recalled a submission of study results before quality control (QC) review took place. If the submission was canceled on or after May 8, 2018, the date is shown. After submission of study results, a study record cannot be modified until QC review is completed, unless the submission is canceled. \n*   Certain agreements Information required by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In general, this is a description of any agreement between the sponsor of a clinical study and the principal investigator (PI) that does not allow the PI to discuss the results of the study or publish the study results in a scientific or academic journal after the study is completed. \n*   Certification A sponsor or investigator may submit a certification to delay submission of results information if they are applying for FDA approval of a new drug or device, or new use of an already approved drug or device. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after the certification/extension first submitted date, unless certain events occur sooner. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information about this certification. \n*   Certification/extension first posted The date on which information about a certification to delay submission of results or an extension request was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate whether the submission was a certification or extension request. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the certification or extension request and the first posted date. \n*   Certification/extension first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request to delay submission of results. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after this date, unless certain events occur sooner. There is typically a delay between the date the certification or extension request was submitted and the date the information is first available on ClinicalTrials.gov (certification/extension first posted). \n*   Certification/extension first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a certification or extension request one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. Meeting QC criteria for an extension request does not mean that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has determined that the request demonstrates good cause. The process for review and granting of extension requests by the NIH is being developed. \n*   Clinical study A research study involving human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two types of clinical studies: interventional studies (also called clinical trials) and observational studies. \n*   Clinical trial Another name for an interventional study. \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number)The unique identification code given to each clinical study upon registration at ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). \n*   Collaborator An organization other than the sponsor that provides support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. \n*   Condition/disease The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. On ClinicalTrials.gov, conditions may also include other health-related issues, such as lifespan, quality of life, and health risks. \n*   Contact The name and contact information for the person who can answer enrollment questions for a clinical study. Each location where the study is being conducted may also have a specific contact, who may be better able to answer those questions. \n*   Cross-over assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order. For example, two-by-two cross-over assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A during the initial phase of the trial, followed by drug B during a later phase. The other group receives drug B during the initial phase, followed by drug A. So during the trial, participants \"cross over\" to the other drug. All participants receive drug A and drug B at some point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are assigned. \n*   Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)A group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial. The DMC can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective, is harming participants, or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose. Members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial. Also called a data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB. \n*   Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0)A phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body. They involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies). \n*   Eligibility criteria The key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have. Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating). Types of eligibility criteria include whether a study  accepts healthy volunteers, has age or age group requirements, or is limited by sex. \n*   Enrollment The number of participants in a clinical study. The \"estimated\" enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study. \n*   Exclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Expanded access A way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also called compassionate use. There are different expanded access types. \nFor more information, see FDA [Expanded Access: Information for Patients](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access \"Expanded Access: Information for Patients (opens in a new tab)\"). \n*   Expanded access status\n\n    *   **Available:**Expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment, and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug, biologic, or medical device being studied.\n    *   **No longer available:**Expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future.\n    *   **Temporarily not available:**Expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future.\n    *   **Approved for marketing:** The intervention has been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the public.\n\n*   Expanded access type\n\nDescribes the category of expanded access under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. There are three types of expanded access: \n    *   **Individual Patients**: Allows a single patient, with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial, access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This category also includes access in an emergency situation.\n    *   **Intermediate-size Population**: Allows more than one patient (but generally fewer patients than through a Treatment IND/Protocol) access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.\n    *   **[](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)Treatment IND/Protocol**: Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use.\n\n*   Experimental arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial. \n*   Extension request In certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial). All requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information. \n*   Facility name The name of the hospital or institution where a clinical study takes place. Note that not all study records include this information. To use this filter, you can enter some or all of a facility name, or type a few letters and select from the list that appears. \n*   Factorial assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, two-by-two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants. Each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions: (1) drug A and drug B, (2) drug A and a placebo, (3) a placebo and drug B, or (4) a placebo and a placebo. So during the trial, all possible combinations of the two drugs (A and B) and the placebos are given to different groups of participants. \n*   FDAAA 801 Violations\n\nA FDAAA 801 Violation is shown on a study record when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Notice of Noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial. A Notice of Noncompliance indicates that the FDA has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801).\nThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) is required by FDAAA 801 to add information to a study record about any FDAAA 801 Violation. This information is provided by the FDA. There are three categories of information that may be included:\n\n    *   Violation: Shown when the FDA issues a Notice of Noncompliance and posts the Notice of Noncompliance on its designated webpage. There are three types of violations:\n        *   Failure to submit required clinical trial information\n        *   Submission of false or misleading clinical trial information\n        *   Failure to submit primary and secondary outcomes\n\n    *   Correction: Shown when the FDA confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage. Because of the time for FDA review and processing, there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the FDAAA 801 Violation information. \n    *   Penalty: Shown when the FDA imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage.\n\n*   First posted The date on which the study record was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/protocol-registration-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay of a few days between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the study record and the first posted date. \n*   First submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the first submitted date and the record's availability on ClinicalTrials.gov (the first posted date). \n*   First submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a study record one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801)U.S. Public Law 110-85, which was enacted on September 27, 2007. Section 801 of FDAAA amends Section 402 of the U.S. Public Health Service Act to expand ClinicalTrials.gov and create a clinical study results database. For more information on FDAAA 801, see the [Clinical Trial Reporting Requirements](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/reporting-requirements#final-rule) page on this site. \n*   Funder type\n\nDescribes the organization that provides funding or support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. Organizations listed as sponsors and collaborators for a study are considered the funders of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov refers to four types of funders: \n    *   U.S. National Institutes of Health\n    *   Other U.S. Federal agencies (for example, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)\n    *   Industry (for example: pharmaceutical and device companies)\n    *   All others (including individuals, universities, and community-based organizations)\n\n*   Gender-based eligibility A type of eligibility criteria that indicates whether eligibility to participate in a clinical study is based on a person's self-representation of gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's own sense of gender, which may or may not be the same as their biological sex. \n*   Group/cohort A group or subgroup of participants in an observational study that is assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. \n*   Human subjects protection review board A group of people who review, approve, and monitor the clinical study's protocol. Their role is to protect the rights and welfare of people participating in a study (referred to as human research subjects), such as reviewing the informed consent form. The group typically includes people with varying backgrounds, including a community member, to make sure that research activities conducted by an organization are completely and adequately reviewed. Also called an institutional review board, or IRB, or an ethics committee.\nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Inclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are the reasons that a person is allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Informed consent A process used by researchers to communicate to potential and enrolled participants the risks and potential benefits of participating in a clinical study. \nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Informed consent form (ICF)The document used in the informed consent or process. \n*   Intervention model The general design of the strategy for assigning interventions to participants in a clinical study. Types of intervention models include: single group assignment, parallel assignment, cross-over assignment, and factorial assignment. \n*   Intervention/treatment A process or action that is the focus of a clinical study. Interventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available. Interventions can also include noninvasive approaches, such as education or modifying diet and exercise. \n*   Interventional study (clinical trial)A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study's protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions. \n*   Investigator A researcher involved in a clinical study. Related terms include site principal investigator, site sub-investigator, study chair, study director, and study principal investigator. \n*   Last update posted The most recent date on which changes to a study record were made available on ClinicalTrials.gov. There may be a delay between when the changes were submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov by the study's sponsor or investigator (the last update submitted date) and the last update posted date. \n*   Last update submitted The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the last update submitted date and when the date changes are posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (the last update posted date). \n*   Last update submitted that met QC criteria The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record that are consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Last verified The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator confirmed the information about a clinical study on ClinicalTrials.gov as accurate and current. If a study with a recruitment status of recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting has not been confirmed within the past 2 years, the study's recruitment status is shown as unknown. \n*   Location A place where a research site for a clinical study can be found. Location information can be searched using a facility name, a city, state, zip code, or country. A location where a study is being conducted may also include contact information.  \n*   Location countries Countries in which research facilities for a study are located. A country is listed only once, even if there is more than one facility in the country. The list includes all countries as of the last update submitted date; any country for which all facilities were removed from the study record are listed under removed location countries. \n*   Masking A clinical trial design strategy in which one or more parties involved in the trial, such as the investigator or participants, do not know which participants have been assigned which interventions. Types of masking include: open label, single blind masking, and double-blind masking. \n*   NCT number A unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). Also called the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. \n*   No intervention arm An arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention/treatment during the clinical trial. \n*   Observational study A type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions/treatment.\nA patient registry is a type of observational study. \n*   Observational study model The general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study. Types of observational study models include cohort, case-control, case-only, case-cross-over, ecologic or community studies, family-based, and other. \n*   Other adverse event An adverse event that is not a serious adverse event, meaning that it does not result in death, is not life-threatening, does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay, does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions, and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect; it also does not put the participant in danger and does not require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Other study IDs Identifiers or ID numbers other than the NCT number that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others. These numbers may include unique identifiers from other trial registries and National Institutes of Health grant numbers. \n*   Other terms In the search feature, the Other terms field is used to narrow a search. For example, you may enter the name of a drug or the NCT number of a clinical study to limit the search to study records that contain these words. \n*   Outcome measure For clinical trials, a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention/treatment on participants. For observational studies, a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits, or associations with exposures, risk factors, or treatment. Types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure. \n*   Parallel assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions. For example, a two-arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A, and the other group receives drug B. So during the trial, participants in one group receive drug A \"in parallel\" to participants in the other group, who receive drug B. \n*   Participant flow A summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study, by study arm or group/cohort. This includes the number of participants who started, completed, and dropped out of the study. \n*   Patient registry A type of observational study that collects information about patients' medical conditions and/or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world. \n*   Phase The stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product, based on definitions developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. There are five phases: Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0), Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4. Not Applicable is used to describe trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Phase 1 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants. \n*   Phase 2 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short-term adverse events are studied. \n*   Phase 3 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug's safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. These studies typically involve more participants. \n*   Phase 4 A phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing. They include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor. These trials gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. \n*   Phase Not Applicable Describes trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Placebo An inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as, and is given in the same way as, an active drug or intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Placebo comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial. \n*   Primary completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure. Whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date. For clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures. The \"estimated\" primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study.  \n*   Primary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, the planned outcome measure that is the most important for evaluating the effect of an intervention/treatment. Most clinical studies have one primary outcome measure, but some have more than one. \n*   Primary purpose The main reason for the clinical trial. The types of primary purpose are: treatment, prevention, diagnostic, supportive care, screening, health services research, basic science, and other. \n*   Principal investigator (PI)The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. \n*   Protocol The written description of a clinical study. It includes the study's objectives, design, and methods. It may also include relevant scientific background and statistical information. \n*   Quality control (QC) review National Library of Medicine (NLM) staff perform a limited review of submitted study records for apparent errors, deficiencies, or inconsistencies. NLM staff identify potential major and advisory issues and provide comments directly to the study sponsor or investigator. Major issues identified in QC review must be addressed or corrected (see First submitted that met QC criteria and Results first submitted that met QC criteria). Advisory issues are suggestions to help improve the clarity of the record. NLM staff do not verify the scientific validity or relevance of the submitted information. The study sponsor or investigator is responsible for ensuring that the studies follow all applicable laws and regulations. \n*   Randomized allocation A type of allocation strategy in which participants are assigned to the arms of a clinical trial by chance. \n*   Recruitment status\n\n    *   **Not yet recruiting:** The study has not started recruiting participants.\n    *   **Recruiting:** The study is currently recruiting participants.\n    *   **Enrolling by invitation:** The study is selecting its participants from a population, or group of people, decided on by the researchers in advance. These studies are not open to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria but only to people in that particular population, who are specifically invited to participate.\n    *   **Active, not recruiting:** The study is ongoing, and participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but potential participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled.\n    *   **Suspended:** The study has stopped early but may start again.\n    *   **Terminated:** The study has stopped early and will not start again. Participants are no longer being examined or treated.\n    *   **Completed:** The study has ended normally, and participants are no longer being examined or treated (that is, the last participant's last visit has occurred).\n    *   **Withdrawn:** The study stopped early, before enrolling its first participant.\n    *   **Unknown:** A study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been last verified within the past 2 years.\n\n*   Registration The process of submitting and updating summary information about a clinical study and its protocol, from its beginning to end, to a structured, public Web-based study registry that is accessible to the public, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. \n*   Removed location countries Countries that appeared under location countries but were removed from the study record by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Reporting group A grouping of participants in a clinical study that is used for summarizing the data collected during the study. This grouping may be the same as or different from a study arm or group. \n*   Responsible party The person responsible for submitting information about a clinical study to ClinicalTrials.gov and updating that information. Usually the study sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results database A structured online system, such as the ClinicalTrials.gov results database, that provides the public with access to registration and summary results information for completed or terminated clinical studies. A study with results available on ClinicalTrials.gov is described as having the results \"posted.\" \n**Note:** The ClinicalTrials.gov results database became available in September 2008. Older studies are unlikely to have results available in the database. \n*   Results delayed Indicates that the sponsor or investigator submitted a certification or extension request. \n*   Results first posted The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator first submits summary results information (the results first submitted date) and the results first posted date. Some results information may be available at an earlier date if Results First Posted with QC Comments. \n*   Results first posted with QC comments The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov with quality control review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) identifying major issues that must be addressed by the sponsor or investigator. As of January 1, 2020, initial results submissions for applicable clinical trials (ACTs) that do not meet [quality control review criteria](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) will be publicly posted on ClinicalTrials.gov with brief standardized major comments. Accordingly, the Results First Posted with QC Comments date may be earlier than the Results First Posted date for an ACT with summary results information that is not consistent with NLM quality control review criteria. \n*   Results first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information. There is typically a delay between the results first submitted date and when summary results information becomes available on ClinicalTrials.gov (the results first posted date). \n*   Results first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit results information one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Results returned after quality control review The date on which the National Library of Medicine provided quality control (QC) review comments to the study sponsor or investigator. The sponsor or investigator must address major issues identified in the review comments. If there is a date listed for results returned after quality control review, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, this means that the submission is pending changes by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator has submitted summary results information for a clinical study to ClinicalTrials.gov but the quality control (QC) review process has not concluded.\nThe results submitted date indicates when the study sponsor or investigator first submitted summary results information or submitted changes to summary results information. Submissions with changes are typically in response to QC review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). If there is a date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results returned after quality control review, this means that the submission is pending review by NLM. \n*   Secondary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, a planned outcome measure that is not as important as the primary outcome measure for evaluating the effect of an intervention but is still of interest. Most clinical studies have more than one secondary outcome measure. \n*   Serious adverse event An adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Sex A type of eligibility criteria that indicates the sex of people who may participate in a clinical study (all, female, male). Sex is a person's classification as female or male based on biological distinctions. Sex is distinct from gender-based eligibility. \n*   Sham comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a procedure or device that appears to be the same as the actual procedure or device being studied but does not contain active processes or components. \n*   Single group assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which all participants receive the same intervention/treatment. \n*   Sort studies by\n\nThe Sort studies by option is used to change the order of studies listed on the Search Results page. You can sort by Relevance or Newest First: \n    *   Relevance: Studies that best match your search terms appear higher in the search results list. This is the default display for all searches.\n    *   Newest First: Studies with the most recent First posted dates appear higher in the search results list.\n\n*   Sponsor The organization or person who initiates the study and who has authority and control over the study. \n*   Statistical analysis plan (SAP)The written description of the statistical considerations and methods for analyzing the data collected in the clinical study. \n*   Status Indicates the current recruitment status or the expanded access status. \n*   Study completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention/treatment to collect final data for the primary outcome measures, secondary outcome measures, and adverse events (that is, the last participant's last visit). The \"estimated\" study completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the study completion date. \n*   Study design The investigative methods and strategies used in the clinical study. \n*   Study documents Refers to the type of documents that the study sponsor or principal investigator may add to their study record. These include a study protocol, statistical analysis plan, and informed consent form. \n*   Study IDs Identifiers that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others. They include unique identifiers from other trial study registries and National Institutes of Health grant numbers. Note: ClinicalTrials.gov assigns a unique identification code to each clinical study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Also called the NCT number, the format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). \n*   Study record An entry on ClinicalTrials.gov that contains a summary of a clinical study's protocol information, including the recruitment status; eligibility criteria; contact information; and, in some cases, summary results. Each study record is assigned a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, or NCT number. \n*   Study registry A structured online system, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, that provides the public with access to summary information about ongoing and completed clinical studies. \n*   Study results A study record that includes the summary results posted in the ClinicalTrials.gov results database. Summary results information includes participant flow, baseline characteristics, outcome measures, and adverse events (including serious adverse events). \n*   Study start date The actual date on which the first participant was enrolled in a clinical study. The \"estimated\" study start date is the date that the researchers think will be the study start date. \n*   Study type Describes the nature of a clinical study. Study types include interventional studies (also called clinical trials), observational studies (including patient registries), and expanded access. \n*   Submitted date The date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. \n*   Title The official title of a protocol used to identify a clinical study or a short title written in language intended for the lay public. \n*   Title acronym The acronym or initials used to identify a clinical study (not all studies have one). For example, the title acronym for the Women's Health Initiative is \"WHI.\" \n*   Type of intervention A process or action that is the focus of a clinical study. Interventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available. Interventions can also include noninvasive approaches, such as education or modifying diet and exercise. \n*   U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)An agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. AHRQ's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. \n*   U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)An agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by making sure that human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products, medical devices, the Nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and products that give off radiation are safe, effective, and secure. \n*   Unknown A type of recruitment status. It identifies a study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been verified within the past 2 years. Studies with an unknown status are considered closed studies. \n\n![Image 1](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/assets/uswds/img/us_flag_small.png)\n\nAn official website of the United States government\n\nHere’s how you know\n\nHere’s how you know\n\n![Image 2](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/assets/uswds/img/icon-dot-gov.svg)\n\n**Official websites use .gov**\n\nA **.gov** website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\n\n![Image 3](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/assets/uswds/img/icon-https.svg)\n\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**\n\nA **lock** ( ) or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website.

This change may or may not be caused by the intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Age or age group\n\nA type of eligibility criteria that indicates the age a person must be to participate in a clinical study. This may be indicated by a specific age or the following age groups:\nThe age groups are:\n\n    *   Child (birth-17)\n    *   Adult (18-64)\n    *   Older Adult (65+)\n\n*   All-cause mortality A measure of all deaths, due to any cause, that occur during a clinical study. \n*   Allocation A method used to assign participants to an arm of a clinical study. The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized. \n*   Arm A group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment, or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol. \n*   Arm type A general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm, active comparator arm, placebo comparator arm, sham comparator arm, and no intervention arm. \n*   Baseline characteristics Data collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment). \n*   Canceled submission Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator recalled a submission of study results before quality control (QC) review took place. If the submission was canceled on or after May 8, 2018, the date is shown. After submission of study results, a study record cannot be modified until QC review is completed, unless the submission is canceled. \n*   Certain agreements Information required by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In general, this is a description of any agreement between the sponsor of a clinical study and the principal investigator (PI) that does not allow the PI to discuss the results of the study or publish the study results in a scientific or academic journal after the study is completed. \n*   Certification A sponsor or investigator may submit a certification to delay submission of results information if they are applying for FDA approval of a new drug or device, or new use of an already approved drug or device. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after the certification/extension first submitted date, unless certain events occur sooner. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information about this certification. \n*   Certification/extension first posted The date on which information about a certification to delay submission of results or an extension request was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate whether the submission was a certification or extension request. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the certification or extension request and the first posted date. \n*   Certification/extension first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request to delay submission of results. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after this date, unless certain events occur sooner. There is typically a delay between the date the certification or extension request was submitted and the date the information is first available on ClinicalTrials.gov (certification/extension first posted). \n*   Certification/extension first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a certification or extension request one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. Meeting QC criteria for an extension request does not mean that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has determined that the request demonstrates good cause. The process for review and granting of extension requests by the NIH is being developed. \n*   Clinical study A research study involving human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two types of clinical studies: interventional studies (also called clinical trials) and observational studies. \n*   Clinical trial Another name for an interventional study. \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number)The unique identification code given to each clinical study upon registration at ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). \n*   Collaborator An organization other than the sponsor that provides support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. \n*   Condition/disease The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. On ClinicalTrials.gov, conditions may also include other health-related issues, such as lifespan, quality of life, and health risks. \n*   Contact The name and contact information for the person who can answer enrollment questions for a clinical study. Each location where the study is being conducted may also have a specific contact, who may be better able to answer those questions. \n*   Cross-over assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order. For example, two-by-two cross-over assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A during the initial phase of the trial, followed by drug B during a later phase. The other group receives drug B during the initial phase, followed by drug A. So during the trial, participants \"cross over\" to the other drug. All participants receive drug A and drug B at some point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are assigned. \n*   Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)A group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial. The DMC can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective, is harming participants, or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose. Members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial. Also called a data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB. \n*   Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0)A phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body. They involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies). \n*   Eligibility criteria The key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have. Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating). Types of eligibility criteria include whether a study  accepts healthy volunteers, has age or age group requirements, or is limited by sex. \n*   Enrollment The number of participants in a clinical study. The \"estimated\" enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study. \n*   Exclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Expanded access A way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also called compassionate use. There are different expanded access types. \nFor more information, see FDA [Expanded Access: Information for Patients](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access \"Expanded Access: Information for Patients (opens in a new tab)\"). \n*   Expanded access status\n\n    *   **Available:**Expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment, and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug, biologic, or medical device being studied.\n    *   **No longer available:**Expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future.\n    *   **Temporarily not available:**Expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future.\n    *   **Approved for marketing:** The intervention has been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the public.\n\n*   Expanded access type\n\nDescribes the category of expanded access under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. There are three types of expanded access: \n    *   **Individual Patients**: Allows a single patient, with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial, access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This category also includes access in an emergency situation.\n    *   **Intermediate-size Population**: Allows more than one patient (but generally fewer patients than through a Treatment IND/Protocol) access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.\n    *   **[](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)Treatment IND/Protocol**: Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use.\n\n*   Experimental arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial. \n*   Extension request In certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial). All requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information. \n*   Facility name The name of the hospital or institution where a clinical study takes place. Note that not all study records include this information. To use this filter, you can enter some or all of a facility name, or type a few letters and select from the list that appears. \n*   Factorial assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, two-by-two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants. Each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions: (1) drug A and drug B, (2) drug A and a placebo, (3) a placebo and drug B, or (4) a placebo and a placebo. So during the trial, all possible combinations of the two drugs (A and B) and the placebos are given to different groups of participants. \n*   FDAAA 801 Violations\n\nA FDAAA 801 Violation is shown on a study record when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Notice of Noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial. A Notice of Noncompliance indicates that the FDA has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801).\nThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) is required by FDAAA 801 to add information to a study record about any FDAAA 801 Violation. This information is provided by the FDA. There are three categories of information that may be included:\n\n    *   Violation: Shown when the FDA issues a Notice of Noncompliance and posts the Notice of Noncompliance on its designated webpage. There are three types of violations:\n        *   Failure to submit required clinical trial information\n        *   Submission of false or misleading clinical trial information\n        *   Failure to submit primary and secondary outcomes\n\n    *   Correction: Shown when the FDA confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage. Because of the time for FDA review and processing, there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the FDAAA 801 Violation information. \n    *   Penalty: Shown when the FDA imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage.\n\n*   First posted The date on which the study record was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/protocol-registration-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay of a few days between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the study record and the first posted date. \n*   First submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the first submitted date and the record's availability on ClinicalTrials.gov (the first posted date). \n*   First submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a study record one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801)U.S. Public Law 110-85, which was enacted on September 27, 2007. Section 801 of FDAAA amends Section 402 of the U.S. Public Health Service Act to expand ClinicalTrials.gov and create a clinical study results database. For more information on FDAAA 801, see the [Clinical Trial Reporting Requirements](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/reporting-requirements#final-rule) page on this site. \n*   Funder type\n\nDescribes the organization that provides funding or support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. Organizations listed as sponsors and collaborators for a study are considered the funders of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov refers to four types of funders: \n    *   U.S. National Institutes of Health\n    *   Other U.S. Federal agencies (for example, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)\n    *   Industry (for example: pharmaceutical and device companies)\n    *   All others (including individuals, universities, and community-based organizations)\n\n*   Gender-based eligibility A type of eligibility criteria that indicates whether eligibility to participate in a clinical study is based on a person's self-representation of gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's own sense of gender, which may or may not be the same as their biological sex. \n*   Group/cohort A group or subgroup of participants in an observational study that is assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. \n*   Human subjects protection review board A group of people who review, approve, and monitor the clinical study's protocol. Their role is to protect the rights and welfare of people participating in a study (referred to as human research subjects), such as reviewing the informed consent form. The group typically includes people with varying backgrounds, including a community member, to make sure that research activities conducted by an organization are completely and adequately reviewed. Also called an institutional review board, or IRB, or an ethics committee.\nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Inclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are the reasons that a person is allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Informed consent A process used by researchers to communicate to potential and enrolled participants the risks and potential benefits of participating in a clinical study. \nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Informed consent form (ICF)The document used in the informed consent or process. \n*   Intervention model The general design of the strategy for assigning interventions to participants in a clinical study. Types of intervention models include: single group assignment, parallel assignment, cross-over assignment, and factorial assignment. \n*   Intervention/treatment A process or action that is the focus of a clinical study. Interventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available. Interventions can also include noninvasive approaches, such as education or modifying diet and exercise. \n*   Interventional study (clinical trial)A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study's protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions. \n*   Investigator A researcher involved in a clinical study. Related terms include site principal investigator, site sub-investigator, study chair, study director, and study principal investigator. \n*   Last update posted The most recent date on which changes to a study record were made available on ClinicalTrials.gov. There may be a delay between when the changes were submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov by the study's sponsor or investigator (the last update submitted date) and the last update posted date. \n*   Last update submitted The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the last update submitted date and when the date changes are posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (the last update posted date). \n*   Last update submitted that met QC criteria The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record that are consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Last verified The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator confirmed the information about a clinical study on ClinicalTrials.gov as accurate and current. If a study with a recruitment status of recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting has not been confirmed within the past 2 years, the study's recruitment status is shown as unknown. \n*   Location A place where a research site for a clinical study can be found. Location information can be searched using a facility name, a city, state, zip code, or country. A location where a study is being conducted may also include contact information.  \n*   Location countries Countries in which research facilities for a study are located. A country is listed only once, even if there is more than one facility in the country. The list includes all countries as of the last update submitted date; any country for which all facilities were removed from the study record are listed under removed location countries. \n*   Masking A clinical trial design strategy in which one or more parties involved in the trial, such as the investigator or participants, do not know which participants have been assigned which interventions. Types of masking include: open label, single blind masking, and double-blind masking. \n*   NCT number A unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). Also called the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. \n*   No intervention arm An arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention/treatment during the clinical trial. \n*   Observational study A type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions/treatment.\nA patient registry is a type of observational study. \n*   Observational study model The general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study. Types of observational study models include cohort, case-control, case-only, case-cross-over, ecologic or community studies, family-based, and other. \n*   Other adverse event An adverse event that is not a serious adverse event, meaning that it does not result in death, is not life-threatening, does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay, does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions, and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect; it also does not put the participant in danger and does not require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Other study IDs Identifiers or ID numbers other than the NCT number that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others. These numbers may include unique identifiers from other trial registries and National Institutes of Health grant numbers. \n*   Other terms In the search feature, the Other terms field is used to narrow a search. For example, you may enter the name of a drug or the NCT number of a clinical study to limit the search to study records that contain these words. \n*   Outcome measure For clinical trials, a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention/treatment on participants. For observational studies, a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits, or associations with exposures, risk factors, or treatment. Types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure. \n*   Parallel assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions. For example, a two-arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A, and the other group receives drug B. So during the trial, participants in one group receive drug A \"in parallel\" to participants in the other group, who receive drug B. \n*   Participant flow A summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study, by study arm or group/cohort. This includes the number of participants who started, completed, and dropped out of the study. \n*   Patient registry A type of observational study that collects information about patients' medical conditions and/or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world. \n*   Phase The stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product, based on definitions developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. There are five phases: Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0), Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4. Not Applicable is used to describe trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Phase 1 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants. \n*   Phase 2 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short-term adverse events are studied. \n*   Phase 3 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug's safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. These studies typically involve more participants. \n*   Phase 4 A phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing. They include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor. These trials gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. \n*   Phase Not Applicable Describes trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Placebo An inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as, and is given in the same way as, an active drug or intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Placebo comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial. \n*   Primary completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure. Whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date. For clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures. The \"estimated\" primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study.  \n*   Primary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, the planned outcome measure that is the most important for evaluating the effect of an intervention/treatment. Most clinical studies have one primary outcome measure, but some have more than one. \n*   Primary purpose The main reason for the clinical trial. The types of primary purpose are: treatment, prevention, diagnostic, supportive care, screening, health services research, basic science, and other. \n*   Principal investigator (PI)The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. \n*   Protocol The written description of a clinical study. It includes the study's objectives, design, and methods. It may also include relevant scientific background and statistical information. \n*   Quality control (QC) review National Library of Medicine (NLM) staff perform a limited review of submitted study records for apparent errors, deficiencies, or inconsistencies. NLM staff identify potential major and advisory issues and provide comments directly to the study sponsor or investigator. Major issues identified in QC review must be addressed or corrected (see First submitted that met QC criteria and Results first submitted that met QC criteria). Advisory issues are suggestions to help improve the clarity of the record. NLM staff do not verify the scientific validity or relevance of the submitted information. The study sponsor or investigator is responsible for ensuring that the studies follow all applicable laws and regulations. \n*   Randomized allocation A type of allocation strategy in which participants are assigned to the arms of a clinical trial by chance. \n*   Recruitment status\n\n    *   **Not yet recruiting:** The study has not started recruiting participants.\n    *   **Recruiting:** The study is currently recruiting participants.\n    *   **Enrolling by invitation:** The study is selecting its participants from a population, or group of people, decided on by the researchers in advance. These studies are not open to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria but only to people in that particular population, who are specifically invited to participate.\n    *   **Active, not recruiting:** The study is ongoing, and participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but potential participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled.\n    *   **Suspended:** The study has stopped early but may start again.\n    *   **Terminated:** The study has stopped early and will not start again. Participants are no longer being examined or treated.\n    *   **Completed:** The study has ended normally, and participants are no longer being examined or treated (that is, the last participant's last visit has occurred).\n    *   **Withdrawn:** The study stopped early, before enrolling its first participant.\n    *   **Unknown:** A study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been last verified within the past 2 years.\n\n*   Registration The process of submitting and updating summary information about a clinical study and its protocol, from its beginning to end, to a structured, public Web-based study registry that is accessible to the public, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. \n*   Removed location countries Countries that appeared under location countries but were removed from the study record by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Reporting group A grouping of participants in a clinical study that is used for summarizing the data collected during the study.

Usually the study sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results database A structured online system, such as the ClinicalTrials.gov results database, that provides the public with access to registration and summary results information for completed or terminated clinical studies. A study with results available on ClinicalTrials.gov is described as having the results \"posted.\" \n**Note:** The ClinicalTrials.gov results database became available in September 2008. Older studies are unlikely to have results available in the database. \n*   Results delayed Indicates that the sponsor or investigator submitted a certification or extension request. \n*   Results first posted The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator first submits summary results information (the results first submitted date) and the results first posted date. Some results information may be available at an earlier date if Results First Posted with QC Comments. \n*   Results first posted with QC comments The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov with quality control review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) identifying major issues that must be addressed by the sponsor or investigator. As of January 1, 2020, initial results submissions for applicable clinical trials (ACTs) that do not meet [quality control review criteria](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) will be publicly posted on ClinicalTrials.gov with brief standardized major comments. Accordingly, the Results First Posted with QC Comments date may be earlier than the Results First Posted date for an ACT with summary results information that is not consistent with NLM quality control review criteria. \n*   Results first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information. There is typically a delay between the results first submitted date and when summary results information becomes available on ClinicalTrials.gov (the results first posted date). \n*   Results first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit results information one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Results returned after quality control review The date on which the National Library of Medicine provided quality control (QC) review comments to the study sponsor or investigator. The sponsor or investigator must address major issues identified in the review comments. If there is a date listed for results returned after quality control review, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, this means that the submission is pending changes by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator has submitted summary results information for a clinical study to ClinicalTrials.gov but the quality control (QC) review process has not concluded.\nThe results submitted date indicates when the study sponsor or investigator first submitted summary results information or submitted changes to summary results information. Submissions with changes are typically in response to QC review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). If there is a date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results returned after quality control review, this means that the submission is pending review by NLM. \n*   Secondary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, a planned outcome measure that is not as important as the primary outcome measure for evaluating the effect of an intervention but is still of interest. Most clinical studies have more than one secondary outcome measure. \n*   Serious adverse event An adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Sex A type of eligibility criteria that indicates the sex of people who may participate in a clinical study (all, female, male). Sex is a person's classification as female or male based on biological distinctions. Sex is distinct from gender-based eligibility. \n*   Sham comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a procedure or device that appears to be the same as the actual procedure or device being studied but does not contain active processes or components. \n*   Single group assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which all participants receive the same intervention/treatment. \n*   Sort studies by\n\nThe Sort studies by option is used to change the order of studies listed on the Search Results page. You can sort by Relevance or Newest First: \n    *   Relevance: Studies that best match your search terms appear higher in the search results list. This is the default display for all searches.\n    *   Newest First: Studies with the most recent First posted dates appear higher in the search results list.\n\n*   Sponsor The organization or person who initiates the study and who has authority and control over the study. \n*   Statistical analysis plan (SAP)The written description of the statistical considerations and methods for analyzing the data collected in the clinical study. \n*   Status Indicates the current recruitment status or the expanded access status. \n*   Study completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention/treatment to collect final data for the primary outcome measures, secondary outcome measures, and adverse events (that is, the last participant's last visit). The \"estimated\" study completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the study completion date. \n*   Study design The investigative methods and strategies used in the clinical study. \n*   Study documents Refers to the type of documents that the study sponsor or principal investigator may add to their study record. These include a study protocol, statistical analysis plan, and informed consent form. \n*   Study IDs Identifiers that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 2.6 Instructions for Preparation and Administration Administration • Administer ADCETRIS as an intravenous infusion only. • Do not mix ADCETRIS with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal products. Reconstitution • Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of hazardous drugs [see References (15)]. • Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions. • Determine the number of 50 mg vials needed based on the patient’s weight and the prescribed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. • Reconstitute each 50 mg vial of ADCETRIS with 10.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to yield a single-dose solution containing 5 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin. • Direct the stream toward the wall of vial and not directly at the cake or powder. • Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. DO NOT SHAKE. • Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless, and free of visible particulates. • Following reconstitution, dilute immediately into an infusion bag. If not diluted immediately, store the solution at 2° to 8°C (36° to46°F) and use within 24 hours of reconstitution. DO NOT FREEZE. • Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Dilution • Calculate the required volume of 5 mg/mL reconstituted ADCETRIS solution needed. • Withdraw this amount from the vial and immediately add it to an infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP to achieve a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL to 1.8 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin. • Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. • Following dilution, infuse the ADCETRIS solution immediately. If not used immediately, store the solution at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and use within 24 hours of reconstitution. DO NOT FREEZE. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS For injection: 50 mg of brentuximab vedotin as a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized, preservative-free cake or powder in a single-dose vial for reconstitution. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ADCETRIS is contraindicated with concomitant bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity (e.g., interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative. In studies of ADCETRIS as monotherapy, 62% of patients experienced any grade of neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 3 months (range, 0–12). Of the patients who experienced neuropathy, 62% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 14% had no improvement at the time of their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 5 months (range, 0–45). Of the patients who reported neuropathy, 38% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation [Grade 1 (27%), Grade 2 (9%), Grade 3 (2%)]. In ECHELON-1 (Study 5), 67% of patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD experienced any grade of neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–7), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0–6) and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, <1–7). The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–32), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0–28), and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, 0–32). Of these patients, 43% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement (a decrease in severity by one or more grades from worst grade), and 33% had no improvement at the time of their last evaluation. Of the patients with residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation (57%), patients had Grade 1 (36%), Grade 2 (16%), Grade 3 (4%), or Grade 4 (<1%) neuropathy. In ECHELON-2 (Study 6), 52% of patients treated with ADCETRIS + CHP experienced new or worsening peripheral neuropathy of any grade (by maximum grade, 34% Grade 1, 15% Grade 2, 3% Grade 3, < 1% Grade 4). The peripheral neuropathy was predominantly sensory (94% sensory, 16% motor) and had a median onset time of 2 months (range, <1–5). At last evaluation, 50% had complete resolution of neuropathy, 12% had partial improvement, and 38% had no improvement. The median time to resolution or improvement overall was 4 months (range, 0–45). Of patients with residual neuropathy at their last evaluation, the neuropathy was Grade 1 in 72%, Grade 2 in 25%, and Grade 3 in 3%. In AHOD1331 (Study 7), 20% of pediatric patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVEPC experienced peripheral neuropathy of any grade (7% Grade 3, <1% Grade 4). Peripheral neuropathy was predominantly sensory. Of the patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, 81% experienced sensory neuropathy and 29% experienced motor neuropathy. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Reference ID: 5076251 9 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5.2 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. Patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid. 5.3 Hematologic Toxicities Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (≥1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS. Start primary prophylaxis with G-CSF beginning with Cycle 1 for adult patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL or previously untreated PTCL, and pediatric patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated high risk cHL [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of ADCETRIS. Monitor more frequently for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent ADCETRIS doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. 5.4 Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections Serious infections and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients closely during treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures. 5.6 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Due to higher MMAE exposure, ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions may be more frequent in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCL) <30 mL/min] [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Reference ID: 5076251 10 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5.7 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. Cases have occurred after the first dose of ADCETRIS or after ADCETRIS rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients experiencing new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS. 5.9 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS therapy, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS dosing for any suspected case of PML and discontinue ADCETRIS dosing if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed. 5.10 Pulmonary Toxicity Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement. 5.11 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. 5.12 Gastrointestinal Complications Fatal and serious events of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with preexisting GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI Reference ID: 5076251 11 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately. 5.13 Hyperglycemia Serious events of hyperglycemia, such as new-onset hyperglycemia, exacerbation of pre­ existing diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. In studies of ADCETRIS monotherapy, 8% of patients experienced any grade hyperglycemia, with 6% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia. The median time to onset for any grade or Grade 3 or 4 was 1 month (range 0-10). Hyperglycemia occurred more frequently in patients with high body mass index or diabetes. Monitor serum glucose and if hyperglycemia develops, administer anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ADCETRIS in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including significantly decreased embryo viability, and fetal malformations at maternal exposures that were similar to the clinical dose of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during ADCETRIS treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Peripheral Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] • Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Hematologic Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] • Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] • Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] • Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] • Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] • Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Reference ID: 5076251 12 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

The data below reflect exposure to ADCETRIS in 931 adult patients with cHL including 662 patients who received ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized controlled trial, 269 who received ADCETRIS as monotherapy (167 in a randomized controlled trial and 102 in a single arm trial), and 296 pediatric patients with high risk cHL who received ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy. Data summarizing ADCETRIS exposure are also provided for 347 patients with T-cell lymphoma, including 223 patients with PTCL who received ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial; 58 patients with sALCL who received ADCETRIS monotherapy in a single-arm trial; and 66 patients with pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF who received ADCETRIS monotherapy in a randomized, controlled trial. ADCETRIS was administered intravenously at a dose of either 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with AVD, 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with AVEPC in pediatric patients, 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with CHP, or 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks as monotherapy. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with monotherapy in adult patients were peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in combination with AVD in adult patients were peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, alopecia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anemia, and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in combination with CHP in adult patients were anemia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, lymphopenia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, mucositis, constipation, alopecia, pyrexia, and vomiting. The most common Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in combination with AVEPC in pediatric patients were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and infection. Previously Untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Study 5: ECHELON-1) ADCETRIS in combination with AVD was evaluated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with Stage III or IV cHL in a randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 1334 patients. Patients were randomized to receive up to 6 cycles of ADCETRIS + AVD or ABVD on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The recommended starting dose of ADCETRIS Reference ID: 5076251 13 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda was 1.2 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes, administered approximately 1 hour after completion of AVD therapy. A total of 1321 patients received at least one dose of study treatment (662 ADCETRIS + AVD, 659 ABVD). The median number of treatment cycles in each study arm was 6 (range, 1–6); 76% of patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm received 12 doses of ADCETRIS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. After 75% of patients had started study treatment, the use of prophylactic G-CSF was recommended with the initiation of treatment for all ADCETRIS + AVD treated patients, based on the observed rates of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Among 579 patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 96% experienced neutropenia (21% with Grade 3; 67% with Grade 4), and 21% had febrile neutropenia (14% with Grade 3; 6% with Grade 4). Among 83 patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 61% experienced neutropenia (13% with Grade 3; 27% with Grade 4), and 11% experienced febrile neutropenia (8% with Grade 3; 2% with Grade 4). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 43% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients and 27% of ABVD-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions in ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients were febrile neutropenia (17%), pyrexia (7%), neutropenia and pneumonia (3% each). Adverse reactions that led to dose delays of one or more drugs in more than 5% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients were neutropenia (21%) and febrile neutropenia (8%) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation of one or more drugs in 13% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients. Seven percent of patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. There were 9 on-study deaths among ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients; 7 were associated with neutropenia, and none of these patients had received G-CSF prior to developing neutropenia.

Patients were randomized to receive ADCETRIS + CHP or CHOP for 6 to 8, 21-day cycles. ADCETRIS was administered on Day 1 of each cycle, with a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes, approximately 1 hour after completion of CHP [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The trial required hepatic transaminases ≤3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine ≤2 times ULN and excluded patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy. A total of 449 patients were treated (223 with ADCETRIS + CHP, 226 with CHOP), with 6 cycles planned in 81%. In the ADCETRIS + CHP arm, 70% of patients received 6 cycles, and 18% received 8 cycles. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF was administered to 34% of ADCETRIS + CHP-treated patients and 27% of CHOP-treated patients. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients in the A+CHP arm and in 4% of patients in the CHOP arms, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 38% of ADCETRIS + CHP- treated patients and 35% of CHOP-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in >2% of ADCETRIS + CHP-treated patients included febrile neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (5%), pyrexia (4%), and sepsis (3%). The most common adverse reactions observed ≥2% more in recipients of ADCETRIS + CHP were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, mucositis, pyrexia, vomiting, and anemia. Other common (≥10%) adverse reactions observed ≥2% more with ADCETRIS + CHP were febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, dyspnea, edema, cough, dizziness, hypokalemia, decreased weight, and myalgia. In recipients of ADCETRIS + CHP, adverse reactions led to dose delays of ADCETRIS in 25% of patients, dose reduction in 9% (most often for peripheral neuropathy), and discontinuation of ADCETRIS with or without the other components in 7% (most often from peripheral neuropathy and infection).

The most common adverse reactions in Studies 1-4 (≥3% in any study) associated with infusion-related reactions were chills (4%), nausea (3–4%), dyspnea (2–3%), pruritus (2–5%), pyrexia (2%), and cough (2%). Grade 3 events were reported in 5 of the 51 ADCETRIS-treated patients who experienced infusion-related reactions. In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD (Study 5, ECHELON-1), infusion-related reactions were reported in 57 patients (9%) in the ADCETRIS + AVD-treated arm. Grade 3 events were reported in 3 of the 57 patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD who experienced infusion-related reactions. The most common adverse reaction (≥2%) associated with infusion-related reactions was nausea (2%). In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP (Study 6, ECHELON-2), infusion-related reactions were reported in 10 patients (4%) in the ADCETRIS + CHP-treated arm: 2 (1%) patients with events that were Grade 3 or higher events, and 8 (4%) patients with events that were less than Grade 3. Pulmonary toxicity In a trial in patients with cHL that studied ADCETRIS with bleomycin as part of a combination regimen, the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was higher than the historical incidence reported with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Patients typically reported cough and dyspnea. Interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation were observed on radiographs and computed tomographic imaging of the chest. Most patients responded to corticosteroids. The concomitant use of ADCETRIS with bleomycin is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD (Study 5, ECHELON-1), non-infectious pulmonary toxicity events were reported in 12 patients (2%) in the ADCETRIS + AVD arm. Reference ID: 5076251 25 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda These events included lung infiltration (6 patients) and pneumonitis (6 patients), or interstitial lung disease (1 patient). In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP (Study 6, ECHELON-2), non-infectious pulmonary toxicity events were reported in 5 patients (2%) in the ADCETRIS + CHP arm; all 5 events were pneumonitis. Cases of pulmonary toxicity have also been reported in patients receiving ADCETRIS monotherapy. In Study 3 (AETHERA), pulmonary toxicity was reported in 8 patients (5%) in the ADCETRIS-treated arm and 5 patients (3%) in the placebo arm. Immunogenicity: Anti-Drug Antibody-Associated Adverse Reactions During treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL and relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL in Studies 1 and 2, two of the patients (1%) with persistently positive antibodies experienced adverse reactions consistent with infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Overall, a higher incidence of infusion related reactions was observed in patients who developed persistently positive antibodies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ADCETRIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: febrile neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Gastrointestinal disorders: acute pancreatitis and gastrointestinal complications (including fatal outcomes) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Infections: PML [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.9)], serious infections and opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and ARDS (some with fatal outcomes) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, including fatal outcomes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ADCETRIS CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Co-administration of ADCETRIS with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased exposure to MMAE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reaction. Closely monitor adverse reactions when ADCETRIS is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm based on the findings from animal studies and the drug’s mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In animal reproduction studies, administration of brentuximab vedotin to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses similar to the clinical dose of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including congenital malformations (see Data). The available data from case reports on ADCETRIS use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal developmental study, pregnant rats received 2 intravenous doses of 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin during the period of organogenesis (once each on Pregnancy Days 6 and 13). Drug-induced embryo-fetal toxicities were seen mainly in animals treated with 3 and 10 mg/kg of the drug and included increased early resorption (≥99%), post-implantation loss (≥99%), decreased numbers of live fetuses, and external malformations (i.e., umbilical hernias and malrotated hindlimbs). Systemic exposure in animals at the brentuximab vedotin dose of 3 mg/kg is approximately the same exposure in patients with cHL or sALCL who received the recommended dose of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of brentuximab vedotin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from ADCETRIS, including cytopenias and neurologic or gastrointestinal toxicities, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during ADCETRIS treatment.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm based on the findings from animal studies and the drug’s mechanism of action [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ADCETRIS therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during ADCETRIS treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Males ADCETRIS may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Males Based on findings in rats, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with ADCETRIS [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ADCETRIS have been established in pediatric patients age 2 and older with previously untreated high risk classical Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide.

No new safety signals were identified in this study. Relapsed or Refractory Systemic ALCL (sALCL) ADCETRIS monotherapy The safety and effectiveness of ADCETRIS monotherapy was assessed but have not been established based on a study (NCT01492088) in 36 patients, which included 16 pediatric patients age 7 to less than 17 with sALCL. No new safety signals were identified in this study. Newly Diagnosed ALK+ ALCL The safety and effectiveness of ADCETRIS in combination with alternating chemotherapy Courses A (dexamethasone, ifosfamide, methotrexate, etoposide, cytarabine) and B (dexamethasone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) administered every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles was assessed but have not been established based on a study (NCT01979536) in 67 patients, which included 61 pediatric patients age 2 to less than 17 with newly diagnosed ALK+ ALCL. No new safety signals were identified in this study. Reference ID: 5076251 29 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical trial of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD for patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL (Study 5: ECHELON-1), 9% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients were age 65 or older. Older age was a risk factor for febrile neutropenia, occurring in 39% of patients who were age 65 or older versus 17% of patients less than age 65, who received ADCETRIS + AVD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The ECHELON-1 trial did not contain sufficient information on patients age 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In the clinical trial of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP for patients with previously untreated, CD30-expressing PTCL (Study 6: ECHELON-2), 31% of ADCETRIS + CHP-treated patients were age 65 or older. Among older patients, 74% had adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 and 49% had serious adverse reactions. Among patients younger than age 65, 62% had adverse reactions ≥ Grade 3 and 33% had serious adverse reactions. Older age was a risk factor for febrile neutropenia, occurring in 29% of patients who were age 65 or older versus 14% of patients less than age 65. Other clinical trials of ADCETRIS in cHL (Study 1; Study 3: AETHERA) and sALCL (Study 2) did not include sufficient numbers of patients who were age 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In the clinical trial of ADCETRIS in pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF (Study 4: ALCANZA), 42% of ADCETRIS-treated patients were age 65 or older. No meaningful differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dosage adjustment is required for mild (CrCL >50–80 mL/min) or moderate (CrCL 30–50 mL/min) renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage reduction is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdosage of ADCETRIS. In case of overdosage, the patient should be closely monitored for adverse reactions, particularly neutropenia, and supportive treatment should be administered. 11 DESCRIPTION ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: 1) the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, 2) the Reference ID: 5076251 30 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda microtubule disrupting agent MMAE, and 3) a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. Brentuximab vedotin has an approximate molecular weight of 153 kDa. Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Brentuximab vedotin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) for Injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder in single-dose vials. Following reconstitution with 10.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, a solution containing 5 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin is produced. The reconstituted product contains 70 mg/mL trehalose dihydrate, 5.6 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.21 mg/mL citric acid monohydrate, and 0.20 mg/mL polysorbate 80 and water for injection. The pH is approximately 6.6. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and is expressed on the surface of sALCL cells and on Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cHL. CD30 is variably expressed in other T-cell lymphomas. Expression of CD30 on healthy tissue and cells is limited. In vitro data suggest that signaling through CD30-CD30L binding may affect cell survival and proliferation. Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC. The antibody is a chimeric IgG1 directed against CD30. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent. MMAE is covalently attached to the antibody via a linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of ADCETRIS is due to the binding of the ADC to CD30-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-CD30 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cells. Additionally, in vitro data provide evidence for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Reference ID: 5076251 31 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in combination therapy were similar to those in monotherapy. Total antibody and ADC had similar pharmacokinetic profiles. The pharmacokinetics of the ADC and MMAE are presented. ADC Maximum concentrations of ADC were observed near the end of infusion. Exposures were approximately dose proportional from 1.2 to 2.7 mg/kg (1.5 times the highest approved recommended dosage). • 1.8 mg/kg Q3W: Steady state was achieved within 21 days, and minimal to no accumulation of ADC was observed. • 1.2 mg/kg Q2W: Steady state was achieved within 56 days, 1.27-fold accumulation (14­ day AUC) was observed. MMAE Maximum concentrations of MMAE were observed approximately 1 to 3 days after end of infusion. Exposures decreased with continued administration of ADCETRIS with approximately 50% to 80% of the exposure of the first dose observed at subsequent doses. • 1.8 mg/kg Q3W: Steady state was achieved within 21 days. • 1.2 mg/kg Q2W: Steady state was achieved within 56 days. Distribution In humans, the mean steady state volume of distribution was approximately 6–10 L for ADC. In vitro, the binding of MMAE to human plasma proteins ranged from 68–82%. MMAE is not likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein-bound drugs. Elimination ADC elimination exhibited a multi-exponential decline with a t1/2 of approximately 4 to 6 days. MMAE elimination exhibited a mono-exponential decline with a t1/2 of approximately 3 to 4 days. Elimination of MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from ADC. Metabolism A small fraction of MMAE released from brentuximab vedotin is metabolized. In vitro data indicate that the MMAE metabolism that occurs is primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4/5. Reference ID: 5076251 32 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Excretion After a single dose of 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS in patients, approximately 24% of the total MMAE administered was recovered in both urine and feces over a 1-week period, approximately 72% of which was recovered in the feces, and the majority was excreted unchanged. Specific Populations Sex and race do not have a meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients aged 3 to <6 years (N=3), 6 to <12 years (N=30) and 12 to <17 years (N=32). Following the recommended dosage of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Q3W, the dose-normalized steady state Cavg of brentuximab vedotin in patients 12 to <17 years of age were generally consistent with those in adult patients administered brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg Q2W. The median AUC of ADC was 22% lower in patients 6 to <12 years of age (median [range] body weight = 28.8 kg [16.2, 80.8 kg]), and 37% lower in patients 3 to <6 years of age (median [range] body weight = 17.0 kg [10.7, 31.1 kg]), respectively, compared to that in patients 12 to <17 years of age (median [range] body weight = 52.7 kg [28.5, 123.9 kg]). The AUC of MMAE was 25% lower in patients 6 to <12 years of age, and 41% lower in patients 3 to <6 years of age, respectively, compared to that in patients 12 to <17 years of age. After accounting for body weight, other factors such as age, sex, race, and baseline albumin had no clinically significant effect on the PK of ADC and MMAE in pediatric patients 3 to <17 years of age. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS to patients with mild (CrCL >50–80 mL/min; n=4), moderate (CrCL 30–50 mL/min; n=3) and severe (CrCL <30 mL/min; n=3) renal impairment. The AUC of MMAE was approximately 2-fold higher in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function and not meaningfully altered in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS to patients with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=5) and severe (Child-Pugh C; n=1) hepatic impairment. The AUC of MMAE was approximately 2.3-fold higher in patients with hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Other Drugs on ADCETRIS Reference ID: 5076251 33 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Co-administration of ADCETRIS with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased exposure to MMAE by approximately 34%. Co-administration of ADCETRIS with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, reduced exposure to MMAE by approximately 46%. Effects of ADCETRIS on Other Drugs Co-administration of ADCETRIS did not affect exposure to midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that MMAE inhibits CYP3A4/5 but not other CYP450 isoforms. MMAE did not induce any major CYP450 enzymes in human hepatocytes. In vitro studies indicate that MMAE is a substrate and not an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in the studies described below with incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of ADCETRIS or of other brentuximab vedotin products. Among adult patients with relapsed or refractory cHL and relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL in Studies 1 and 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and (14.3)], treatment-emergent ADA (or anti­ brentuximab vedotin antibodies) developed in 37% (58/156) of patients who were tested for anti­ brentuximab vedotin antibodies. Approximately 7% of patients in these trials developed persistently positive antibodies (positive test at more than 2 time points) and 30% developed transiently positive antibodies (positive at 1 or 2 post-baseline time points). Two of the patients (1%) with persistently positive antibodies experienced adverse reactions consistent with infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment. Overall, a higher incidence of infusion related reactions was observed in patients who developed persistently positive antibodies. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against brentuximab vedotin was 62% (36/58). The effect of anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies on efficacy is not known. Among pediatric patients with previously untreated high risk cHL in Study 7 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], of the 26 patients tested, none of the patients tested positive for anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with brentuximab vedotin or the small molecule (MMAE) have not been conducted. MMAE was genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus study through an aneugenic mechanism. This effect is consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE as a microtubule-Reference ID: 5076251 34 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda disrupting agent. MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay. Fertility studies with brentuximab vedotin or MMAE have not been conducted. However, results of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the potential for brentuximab vedotin to impair male reproductive function and fertility. In a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats with weekly dosing at 0.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin, seminiferous tubule degeneration, Sertoli cell vacuolation, reduced spermatogenesis, and aspermia were observed. Effects in animals were seen mainly at 5 and 10 mg/kg of brentuximab vedotin. These doses are approximately 3 and 6-fold the human recommended dose of 1.8 mg/kg, respectively, based on body weight. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Randomized Clinical Trial in Previously Untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Study 5: ECHELON-1, NCT01712490) The efficacy of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL was evaluated in a randomized, open-label, 2-arm, multicenter trial. Of the 1334 total patients, 664 patients were randomized to the ADCETRIS + doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D] (ADCETRIS + AVD) arm and 670 patients were randomized to the A+ bleomycin [B] + V + D (ABVD) arm. Patients in both treatment arms were treated intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Dosing in each treatment arm was administered according to the following: • ADCETRIS + AVD arm: ADCETRIS 1.2 mg/kg over 30 minutes, doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 • ABVD arm: doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, bleomycin 10 units/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 Efficacy was established based on modified progression-free survival (modified PFS) per independent review facility (IRF). A modified PFS event is defined as progression, death, or receipt of additional anticancer therapy for patients who are not in a complete response (CR) after completion of frontline therapy. Patients had Stage III (36%) or IV disease (64%), and 62% had extranodal involvement at diagnosis. Most patients were male (58%) and white (84%). The median age was 36 years (range, 18-83); 186 patients (14%) were 60 years or older. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 11.

At the time of the modified PFS analysis, an interim OS analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference. The CR rate per IRF assessment at the end of the randomized regimen was 73% on the A+AVD arm and 70% on the ABVD arm. Randomized Clinical Trial in Previously Untreated High Risk classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Study 7, AHOD1331, NCT02166463) 36 Reference ID: 5076251 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda The efficacy of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of pediatric patients (2 to <22 years of age) with previously untreated high risk cHL was evaluated in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial. High risk was defined as Ann Arbor Stage IIB with bulk disease, Stage IIIB, Stage IVA, and Stage IVB. Of the 600 total patients randomized, 300 were randomized to ADCETRIS + Doxorubicin [A], Vincristine [V], Etoposide [E], Prednisone [P], Cyclophosphamide [C] (ADCETRIS + AVEPC) arm and 300 patients were randomized to A+ Bleomycin [B]+V+E+P+C (ABVE-PC) arm. Patients in each treatment arm received up to 5 cycles of the following: • ADCETRIS + AVEPC arm: ADCETRIS 1.8 mg/kg over 30 minutes (day 1), doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (day 8), etoposide 125 mg/m2 (days 1-3), prednisone 20 mg/m2 BID (days 1-7), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2) • ABVE-PC arm: doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2), bleomycin 5 units/m2 (day1) and 10 units/m2 (day 8), vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8), etoposide 125 mg/m2 (days 1­ 3), prednisone 20 mg/m2 BID (days 1-7), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2) The median age was 15 years (range: 3-21 years); 53% were male, 74% were White, 11% Black, and 3% Asian. Nine patients were <6 years, 81 patients were 6 to <12 years, 448 patients were 12 to <18 years, and 62 patients were ≥18 years. Of the 600 enrolled patients, 20% had disease stage of IIB with bulk disease, 19% had IIIB, 29% had IVA, and 31% had IVB. Efficacy was established based on event-free-survival (EFS), defined as the time from randomization to the earliest of disease progression or relapse, second malignancy, or death due to any cause.

Three hundred twenty-nine (329) patients were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or ADCETRIS 1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles, beginning 30–45 days post-auto-HSCT. Patients in the placebo arm with progressive disease per investigator could receive ADCETRIS as part of a separate trial. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) determined by independent review facility (IRF). Standard international guidelines were followed for infection prophylaxis for HSV, VZV, and PJP post-auto-HSCT [see Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)]. High risk of post-auto-HSCT relapse or progression was defined according to status following frontline therapy: refractory, relapse within 12 months, or relapse ≥12 months with extranodal disease. Patients were required to have obtained a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) to most recent pre-auto-HSCT salvage therapy. A total of 329 patients were enrolled and randomized (165 ADCETRIS, 164 placebo); 327 patients received study treatment. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms. The 329 patients ranged in age from 18–76 years (median, 32 years) and most were male (53%) and white (94%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior systemic therapies (range, 2–8) excluding autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

For enrollment, the trial required CD30 expression ≥10% per immunohistochemistry. The trial excluded patients with primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas. The trial required hepatic transaminases ≤3 times ULN, total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine ≤2 times ULN. Of the 452 total patients, 226 patients were randomized to the ADCETRIS + CHP arm and 226 patients were randomized to the CHOP arm. Patients in both treatment arms were treated intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 6 to 8 cycles; prednisone was administered orally on Days 1-5. Dosing in each treatment arm was administered according to the following: • ADCETRIS + CHP arm: ADCETRIS 1.8 mg/kg over 30 minutes, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and prednisone 100 mg orally • CHOP arm: cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, and prednisone 100 mg orally The median age was 58 years (range: 18 to 85), 63% were male, 62% were White, 22% were Asian, and 78% had an ECOG performance status of 0-1.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda prior therapy. Fifty-eight (58) patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. An IRF performed efficacy evaluations which included overall response rate (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) and duration of response as defined by clinical and radiographic measures including computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) as defined in the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (modified). The 58 patients ranged in age from 14–76 years (median, 52 years) and most were male (57%) and white (83%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior therapies; 26% of patients had received prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Fifty percent (50%) of patients were relapsed, and 50% of patients were refractory to their most recent prior therapy. Seventy-two percent (72%) were anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 16. Duration of response is calculated from date of first response to date of progression or data cutoff date.

In ALCANZA, one hundred thirty-one (131) patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ADCETRIS 1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks or physician’s choice of methotrexate (5 to 50 mg orally weekly) or bexarotene (300 mg/m2 orally daily). The randomization was stratified by baseline disease diagnosis (MF or pcALCL). Patients could receive a maximum of 16 cycles (21-day cycle) of therapy every 3 weeks for those receiving brentuximab vedotin or 48 weeks of therapy for those in the control arm. Patients with pcALCL must have received prior radiation or systemic therapy, and must have at least 1 biopsy with CD30-expression of ≥10%. Patients with MF must have received prior systemic therapy and have had skin biopsies from at least 2 separate lesions, with CD30­ expression of ≥10% in at least 1 biopsy. Reference ID: 5076251 44 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda A total of 131 patients were randomized (66 ADCETRIS, 65 physician’s choice). The efficacy results were based on 128 patients (64 patients in each arm with CD30-expression of ≥10% in at least one biopsy). Among 128 patients, the patients’ age ranged from 22–83 years (median, 60 years), and 55% of them were male and 85% of them were white. Patients had received a median of 4 prior therapies (range, 0–15), including a median of 1 prior skin-directed therapy (range, 0–9) and 2 systemic therapies (range, 0–11). At study entry, patients were diagnosed as Stage 1 (25%), Stage 2 (38%), Stage 3 (5%), or Stage 4 (13%). Efficacy was established based on the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (CR+PR) that lasts at least 4 months (ORR4). ORR4 was determined by independent review facility (IRF) using the global response score (GRS), consisting of skin evaluations per modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT), nodal and visceral radiographic assessment, and detection of circulating Sézary cells (MF patients only). Additional efficacy outcome measures included proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) per IRF, and progression-free survival (PFS) per IRF. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 17 below and the Kaplan-Meier curves of IRF-assessed PFS are shown in Figure 6.

Zilovertamab vedotin is an investigational, potential first-in-class antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). At a pre-planned analysis, zilovertamab vedotin 1.75 mg/kg in combination with R-GemOx achieved a 56.3% objective response rate (ORR) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (n=16), with eight complete responses (CR) and one partial response (PR). These data are being presented for the first time today during an oral presentation at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #7005).\n\n“Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma continue to experience poor outcomes and an unmet need remains to help provide these patients with additional options to treat their cancer,” said Dr. Philippe Armand, the study’s principal investigator, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “These data from the Phase 2 portion of the waveLINE-003 trial are encouraging for patients and support further research in the relapsed/refractory setting in a larger patient population.”\n\n“In the Phase 2 portion of the waveLINE-003 trial, the 1.75 mg/kg dose of zilovertamab vedotin with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin demonstrated a promising response rate, complete response rate and manageable safety profile in combination with standard of care,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “The Phase 3 portion of this trial is already enrolling, and as we continue to advance our research of this investigational ROR1-directed ADC, these promising results amplify our belief in the potential of zilovertamab vedotin to treat multiple hematologic malignancies.”\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is currently being evaluated in patients with previously untreated DLBCL in the Phase 3 waveLINE-010 study ([NCT06717347](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06717347&esheet=54262207&newsitemid=20250530306112&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06717347&index=1&md5=7cba67f10fe07d7d95056c53ea635ee5)) and in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 study ([NCT05406401](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05406401&esheet=54262207&newsitemid=20250530306112&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05406401&index=2&md5=3070f6edccf88725f4effacc62a54394)). Additionally, we recently initiated the Phase 2 waveLINE-011 study ([NCT06890884](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06890884%3Fterm%3Dmk-2140-011%26rank%3D1&esheet=54262207&newsitemid=20250530306112&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06890884&index=3&md5=15390dd9ef1861dc05c6bda422dc7188)), which is a randomized, open-label clinical trial evaluating zilovertamab vedotin plus rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) versus polatuzumab vedotin with R-CHP for the treatment of patients with DLBCL. The trial is estimated to enroll 594 patients and the primary endpoint is CR rate at end of treatment, with secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival, duration of CR and safety. Global recruitment of the waveLINE-011 study has begun, with patients now enrolling.\n\nAs [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fresearch-on-novel-treatment-approaches-and-scientific-advances-from-mercks-broad-and-differentiated-oncology-portfolio-and-pipeline-to-be-presented-at-asco-2025%2F&esheet=54262207&newsitemid=20250530306112&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=4&md5=0edb4ef0ccb213d038dc786cf8e8cae3), data spanning more than 25 types of cancer are being presented from Merck’s broad oncology portfolio and investigational pipeline at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting.\n\n**Study design and additional data from waveLINE-003**WaveLINE-003 is a Phase 2/3 randomized, multicenter, open-label, dose confirmation and expansion clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, [NCT05139017](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05139017&esheet=54262207&newsitemid=20250530306112&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05139017&index=5&md5=474bb4cb9808862cdec8cbad3b1727f0)) designed to assess the safety and efficacy of zilovertamab vedotin in combination with standard of care options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL after one or more lines of therapy. This study is divided into two parts: dose confirmation (part 1) and efficacy expansion (part 2) and enrolled adult participants with confirmed relapsed or refractory DLBCL after one or more lines of therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. In Part 1, primary endpoints were safety and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints were ORR, duration of response (DOR) per Lugano 2014 response criteria by blinded independent central review and OS. Part 1 of the trial enrolled 40 patients (as of the August 1, 2024 data cutoff) to receive either:\n\nTreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 98% of patients (n=40). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 63% of patients (n=25). At the 1.5 mg/kg dose of zilovertamab vedotin plus R-GemOx, four patients completed treatment, eight discontinued due to progression and one withdrew, with four patients receiving ongoing treatment at data cut-off. At the 1.75 mg/kg dose, eight patients completed treatment, seven discontinued due to progression and one patient discontinued due to physician decision. In the 2.0 mg/kg dose cohort, three patients completed treatment, three patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs) (treatment-related sepsis and respiratory failure), and one patient withdrew due to physician decision. One patient died after discontinuing treatment due to treatment-related sepsis. The most common AEs were diarrhea, nausea, anemia and platelet count decrease, while the most common Grade ≥3 AEs were neutropenia, neutrophil count decrease, platelet count decrease and anemia.\n\nSeven dose-limiting toxicities occurred across all participants. At the 1.5 mg/kg dose of zilovertamab vedotin plus R-GemOx, one participant had Grade 4 febrile neutropenia. At the 1.75 mg/kg dose, one participant experienced Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase increased and one patient had intestinal obstruction. At the 2.0 mg/kg dose, participants had Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 4 neutrophil count decrease and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (one patient each), and one patient experienced both Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and Grade 4 neutrophil count decrease.\n\nThe median follow-up for all participants was 9.8 months. At a median follow-up of 18.1 months (range, 2.4 to 23.3 months) in patients receiving the 1.5 mg/kg dose of zilovertamab vedotin (n=15), ORR was 26.7% (3 CR [20.0%], 1 PR [6.7%]) and median DOR was 14.4 months (95% CI, not reached [NR]-NR). At a median follow-up of 9.9 months (range, 4.0 to 30.0 months) for patients receiving the 1.75 mg/kg dose (n=16), ORR was 56.3% (8 CR [50.0%], 1 PR [6.3%]) and median DOR was 8.7 months (95% CI, 2.3-NR). At a median follow-up of 9.3 months (range, 6.0 to 10.0 months) for patients receiving the 2.0 mg/kg dose (n=7), the ORR was 57.1% (3 CR [42.9%], 1 PR [14.3%]) and median DOR was not reached (95% CI, 4.1-NR). Based on these results and accompanying safety data, the recommended Phase 2 dose of zilovertamab vedotin was determined to be 1.75 mg/kg when used with R-GemOx.\n\n**About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma**Lymphoma is cancer beginning in the lymphatic system – the network of organs, vessels and tissues that protects the body from infection. There are many subtypes of lymphoma, which is often categorized into two main types – Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of NHL, is derived from white blood cells that grow rapidly and uncontrollably, enlarging the lymph nodes and often migrating to other parts of the body. DLBCL accounts for approximately 25-30% of all NHLs worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL each year. The five-year relative survival rate for DLBCL is 60-70%.\n\n**About zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)**Zilovertamab vedotin is an investigational, potential first-in-class ADC that targets ROR1. ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies.

This change may or may not be caused by the intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Age or age group\n\nA type of eligibility criteria that indicates the age a person must be to participate in a clinical study. This may be indicated by a specific age or the following age groups:\nThe age groups are:\n\n    *   Child (birth-17)\n    *   Adult (18-64)\n    *   Older Adult (65+)\n\n*   All-cause mortality A measure of all deaths, due to any cause, that occur during a clinical study. \n*   Allocation A method used to assign participants to an arm of a clinical study. The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized. \n*   Arm A group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment, or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol. \n*   Arm type A general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm, active comparator arm, placebo comparator arm, sham comparator arm, and no intervention arm. \n*   Baseline characteristics Data collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment). \n*   Canceled submission Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator recalled a submission of study results before quality control (QC) review took place. If the submission was canceled on or after May 8, 2018, the date is shown. After submission of study results, a study record cannot be modified until QC review is completed, unless the submission is canceled. \n*   Certain agreements Information required by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In general, this is a description of any agreement between the sponsor of a clinical study and the principal investigator (PI) that does not allow the PI to discuss the results of the study or publish the study results in a scientific or academic journal after the study is completed. \n*   Certification A sponsor or investigator may submit a certification to delay submission of results information if they are applying for FDA approval of a new drug or device, or new use of an already approved drug or device. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after the certification/extension first submitted date, unless certain events occur sooner. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information about this certification. \n*   Certification/extension first posted The date on which information about a certification to delay submission of results or an extension request was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate whether the submission was a certification or extension request. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the certification or extension request and the first posted date. \n*   Certification/extension first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request to delay submission of results. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after this date, unless certain events occur sooner. There is typically a delay between the date the certification or extension request was submitted and the date the information is first available on ClinicalTrials.gov (certification/extension first posted). \n*   Certification/extension first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a certification or extension request one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. Meeting QC criteria for an extension request does not mean that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has determined that the request demonstrates good cause. The process for review and granting of extension requests by the NIH is being developed. \n*   Clinical study A research study involving human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two types of clinical studies: interventional studies (also called clinical trials) and observational studies. \n*   Clinical trial Another name for an interventional study. \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number)The unique identification code given to each clinical study upon registration at ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). \n*   Collaborator An organization other than the sponsor that provides support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. \n*   Condition/disease The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. On ClinicalTrials.gov, conditions may also include other health-related issues, such as lifespan, quality of life, and health risks. \n*   Contact The name and contact information for the person who can answer enrollment questions for a clinical study. Each location where the study is being conducted may also have a specific contact, who may be better able to answer those questions. \n*   Cross-over assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order. For example, two-by-two cross-over assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A during the initial phase of the trial, followed by drug B during a later phase. The other group receives drug B during the initial phase, followed by drug A. So during the trial, participants \"cross over\" to the other drug. All participants receive drug A and drug B at some point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are assigned. \n*   Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)A group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial. The DMC can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective, is harming participants, or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose. Members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial. Also called a data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB. \n*   Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0)A phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body. They involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies). \n*   Eligibility criteria The key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have. Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating). Types of eligibility criteria include whether a study  accepts healthy volunteers, has age or age group requirements, or is limited by sex. \n*   Enrollment The number of participants in a clinical study. The \"estimated\" enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study. \n*   Exclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Expanded access A way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also called compassionate use. There are different expanded access types. \nFor more information, see FDA [Expanded Access: Information for Patients](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access \"Expanded Access: Information for Patients (opens in a new tab)\"). \n*   Expanded access status\n\n    *   **Available:**Expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment, and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug, biologic, or medical device being studied.\n    *   **No longer available:**Expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future.\n    *   **Temporarily not available:**Expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future.\n    *   **Approved for marketing:** The intervention has been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the public.\n\n*   Expanded access type\n\nDescribes the category of expanded access under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. There are three types of expanded access: \n    *   **Individual Patients**: Allows a single patient, with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial, access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This category also includes access in an emergency situation.\n    *   **Intermediate-size Population**: Allows more than one patient (but generally fewer patients than through a Treatment IND/Protocol) access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.\n    *   **[](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)Treatment IND/Protocol**: Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use.\n\n*   Experimental arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial. \n*   Extension request In certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial). All requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See [Delay Results Type](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information. \n*   Facility name The name of the hospital or institution where a clinical study takes place. Note that not all study records include this information. To use this filter, you can enter some or all of a facility name, or type a few letters and select from the list that appears. \n*   Factorial assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, two-by-two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants. Each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions: (1) drug A and drug B, (2) drug A and a placebo, (3) a placebo and drug B, or (4) a placebo and a placebo. So during the trial, all possible combinations of the two drugs (A and B) and the placebos are given to different groups of participants. \n*   FDAAA 801 Violations\n\nA FDAAA 801 Violation is shown on a study record when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Notice of Noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial. A Notice of Noncompliance indicates that the FDA has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801).\nThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) is required by FDAAA 801 to add information to a study record about any FDAAA 801 Violation. This information is provided by the FDA. There are three categories of information that may be included:\n\n    *   Violation: Shown when the FDA issues a Notice of Noncompliance and posts the Notice of Noncompliance on its designated webpage. There are three types of violations:\n        *   Failure to submit required clinical trial information\n        *   Submission of false or misleading clinical trial information\n        *   Failure to submit primary and secondary outcomes\n\n    *   Correction: Shown when the FDA confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage. Because of the time for FDA review and processing, there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the FDAAA 801 Violation information. \n    *   Penalty: Shown when the FDA imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage.\n\n*   First posted The date on which the study record was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/protocol-registration-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay of a few days between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the study record and the first posted date. \n*   First submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the first submitted date and the record's availability on ClinicalTrials.gov (the first posted date). \n*   First submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a study record one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801)U.S. Public Law 110-85, which was enacted on September 27, 2007. Section 801 of FDAAA amends Section 402 of the U.S. Public Health Service Act to expand ClinicalTrials.gov and create a clinical study results database. For more information on FDAAA 801, see the [Clinical Trial Reporting Requirements](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/policy/reporting-requirements#final-rule) page on this site. \n*   Funder type\n\nDescribes the organization that provides funding or support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. Organizations listed as sponsors and collaborators for a study are considered the funders of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov refers to four types of funders: \n    *   U.S. National Institutes of Health\n    *   Other U.S. Federal agencies (for example, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)\n    *   Industry (for example: pharmaceutical and device companies)\n    *   All others (including individuals, universities, and community-based organizations)\n\n*   Gender-based eligibility A type of eligibility criteria that indicates whether eligibility to participate in a clinical study is based on a person's self-representation of gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's own sense of gender, which may or may not be the same as their biological sex. \n*   Group/cohort A group or subgroup of participants in an observational study that is assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. \n*   Human subjects protection review board A group of people who review, approve, and monitor the clinical study's protocol. Their role is to protect the rights and welfare of people participating in a study (referred to as human research subjects), such as reviewing the informed consent form. The group typically includes people with varying backgrounds, including a community member, to make sure that research activities conducted by an organization are completely and adequately reviewed. Also called an institutional review board, or IRB, or an ethics committee.\nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Inclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria.

Types of intervention models include: single group assignment, parallel assignment, cross-over assignment, and factorial assignment. \n*   Intervention/treatment A process or action that is the focus of a clinical study. Interventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available. Interventions can also include noninvasive approaches, such as education or modifying diet and exercise. \n*   Interventional study (clinical trial)A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study's protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions. \n*   Investigator A researcher involved in a clinical study. Related terms include site principal investigator, site sub-investigator, study chair, study director, and study principal investigator. \n*   Last update posted The most recent date on which changes to a study record were made available on ClinicalTrials.gov. There may be a delay between when the changes were submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov by the study's sponsor or investigator (the last update submitted date) and the last update posted date. \n*   Last update submitted The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the last update submitted date and when the date changes are posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (the last update posted date). \n*   Last update submitted that met QC criteria The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record that are consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Last verified The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator confirmed the information about a clinical study on ClinicalTrials.gov as accurate and current. If a study with a recruitment status of recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting has not been confirmed within the past 2 years, the study's recruitment status is shown as unknown. \n*   Location A place where a research site for a clinical study can be found. Location information can be searched using a facility name, a city, state, zip code, or country. A location where a study is being conducted may also include contact information.  \n*   Location countries Countries in which research facilities for a study are located. A country is listed only once, even if there is more than one facility in the country. The list includes all countries as of the last update submitted date; any country for which all facilities were removed from the study record are listed under removed location countries. \n*   Masking A clinical trial design strategy in which one or more parties involved in the trial, such as the investigator or participants, do not know which participants have been assigned which interventions. Types of masking include: open label, single blind masking, and double-blind masking. \n*   NCT number A unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). Also called the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. \n*   No intervention arm An arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention/treatment during the clinical trial. \n*   Observational study A type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions/treatment.\nA patient registry is a type of observational study. \n*   Observational study model The general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study. Types of observational study models include cohort, case-control, case-only, case-cross-over, ecologic or community studies, family-based, and other. \n*   Other adverse event An adverse event that is not a serious adverse event, meaning that it does not result in death, is not life-threatening, does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay, does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions, and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect; it also does not put the participant in danger and does not require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Other study IDs Identifiers or ID numbers other than the NCT number that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others. These numbers may include unique identifiers from other trial registries and National Institutes of Health grant numbers. \n*   Other terms In the search feature, the Other terms field is used to narrow a search. For example, you may enter the name of a drug or the NCT number of a clinical study to limit the search to study records that contain these words. \n*   Outcome measure For clinical trials, a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention/treatment on participants. For observational studies, a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits, or associations with exposures, risk factors, or treatment. Types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure. \n*   Parallel assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions. For example, a two-arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A, and the other group receives drug B. So during the trial, participants in one group receive drug A \"in parallel\" to participants in the other group, who receive drug B. \n*   Participant flow A summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study, by study arm or group/cohort. This includes the number of participants who started, completed, and dropped out of the study. \n*   Patient registry A type of observational study that collects information about patients' medical conditions and/or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world. \n*   Phase The stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product, based on definitions developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. There are five phases: Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0), Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4. Not Applicable is used to describe trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Phase 1 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants. \n*   Phase 2 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short-term adverse events are studied. \n*   Phase 3 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug's safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. These studies typically involve more participants. \n*   Phase 4 A phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing. They include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor. These trials gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. \n*   Phase Not Applicable Describes trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Placebo An inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as, and is given in the same way as, an active drug or intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Placebo comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial. \n*   Primary completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure. Whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date. For clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures. The \"estimated\" primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study.  \n*   Primary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, the planned outcome measure that is the most important for evaluating the effect of an intervention/treatment. Most clinical studies have one primary outcome measure, but some have more than one. \n*   Primary purpose The main reason for the clinical trial. The types of primary purpose are: treatment, prevention, diagnostic, supportive care, screening, health services research, basic science, and other. \n*   Principal investigator (PI)The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. \n*   Protocol The written description of a clinical study. It includes the study's objectives, design, and methods. It may also include relevant scientific background and statistical information. \n*   Quality control (QC) review National Library of Medicine (NLM) staff perform a limited review of submitted study records for apparent errors, deficiencies, or inconsistencies. NLM staff identify potential major and advisory issues and provide comments directly to the study sponsor or investigator. Major issues identified in QC review must be addressed or corrected (see First submitted that met QC criteria and Results first submitted that met QC criteria). Advisory issues are suggestions to help improve the clarity of the record. NLM staff do not verify the scientific validity or relevance of the submitted information. The study sponsor or investigator is responsible for ensuring that the studies follow all applicable laws and regulations. \n*   Randomized allocation A type of allocation strategy in which participants are assigned to the arms of a clinical trial by chance. \n*   Recruitment status\n\n    *   **Not yet recruiting:** The study has not started recruiting participants.\n    *   **Recruiting:** The study is currently recruiting participants.\n    *   **Enrolling by invitation:** The study is selecting its participants from a population, or group of people, decided on by the researchers in advance. These studies are not open to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria but only to people in that particular population, who are specifically invited to participate.\n    *   **Active, not recruiting:** The study is ongoing, and participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but potential participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled.\n    *   **Suspended:** The study has stopped early but may start again.\n    *   **Terminated:** The study has stopped early and will not start again. Participants are no longer being examined or treated.\n    *   **Completed:** The study has ended normally, and participants are no longer being examined or treated (that is, the last participant's last visit has occurred).\n    *   **Withdrawn:** The study stopped early, before enrolling its first participant.\n    *   **Unknown:** A study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been last verified within the past 2 years.\n\n*   Registration The process of submitting and updating summary information about a clinical study and its protocol, from its beginning to end, to a structured, public Web-based study registry that is accessible to the public, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. \n*   Removed location countries Countries that appeared under location countries but were removed from the study record by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Reporting group A grouping of participants in a clinical study that is used for summarizing the data collected during the study.

Some results information may be available at an earlier date if Results First Posted with QC Comments. \n*   Results first posted with QC comments The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov with quality control review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) identifying major issues that must be addressed by the sponsor or investigator. As of January 1, 2020, initial results submissions for applicable clinical trials (ACTs) that do not meet [quality control review criteria](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) will be publicly posted on ClinicalTrials.gov with brief standardized major comments. Accordingly, the Results First Posted with QC Comments date may be earlier than the Results First Posted date for an ACT with summary results information that is not consistent with NLM quality control review criteria. \n*   Results first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information. There is typically a delay between the results first submitted date and when summary results information becomes available on ClinicalTrials.gov (the results first posted date). \n*   Results first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria.

It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Results returned after quality control review The date on which the National Library of Medicine provided quality control (QC) review comments to the study sponsor or investigator. The sponsor or investigator must address major issues identified in the review comments. If there is a date listed for results returned after quality control review, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, this means that the submission is pending changes by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator has submitted summary results information for a clinical study to ClinicalTrials.gov but the quality control (QC) review process has not concluded.\nThe results submitted date indicates when the study sponsor or investigator first submitted summary results information or submitted changes to summary results information. Submissions with changes are typically in response to QC review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). If there is a date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results returned after quality control review, this means that the submission is pending review by NLM. \n*   Secondary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, a planned outcome measure that is not as important as the primary outcome measure for evaluating the effect of an intervention but is still of interest. Most clinical studies have more than one secondary outcome measure. \n*   Serious adverse event An adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Sex A type of eligibility criteria that indicates the sex of people who may participate in a clinical study (all, female, male). Sex is a person's classification as female or male based on biological distinctions. Sex is distinct from gender-based eligibility. \n*   Sham comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a procedure or device that appears to be the same as the actual procedure or device being studied but does not contain active processes or components. \n*   Single group assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which all participants receive the same intervention/treatment. \n*   Sort studies by\n\nThe Sort studies by option is used to change the order of studies listed on the Search Results page. You can sort by Relevance or Newest First: \n    *   Relevance: Studies that best match your search terms appear higher in the search results list. This is the default display for all searches.\n    *   Newest First: Studies with the most recent First posted dates appear higher in the search results list.\n\n*   Sponsor The organization or person who initiates the study and who has authority and control over the study. \n*   Statistical analysis plan (SAP)The written description of the statistical considerations and methods for analyzing the data collected in the clinical study. \n*   Status Indicates the current recruitment status or the expanded access status. \n*   Study completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention/treatment to collect final data for the primary outcome measures, secondary outcome measures, and adverse events (that is, the last participant's last visit).

Zilovertamab vedotin had a manageable safety and tolerability profile, regardless of the dosing schedule, with 16% of participants experiencing treatment-related serious AEs. Pharmacokinetic results suggested potential benefits with Q2/3W dosing compared with Q1/3W dosing. In the phase 1, dose-escalation waveLINE-001 study (7, 14), the ORR was 37% (95% CI, 22%–53%) with 5 complete responses and 10 partial responses among 41 participants treated with zilovertamab vedotin up to 2.5 mg/kg Q1/3W (7). Our study of zilovertamab vedotin monotherapy reports on an ADC targeting ROR1 for the treatment of participants with advanced solid tumors.",

We evaluated zilovertamab vedotin in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors.\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\nThis phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized study (NCT04504916) enrolled participants with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, nonsquamous non–small-cell lung cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, or pancreatic cancer. Participants received zilovertamab vedotin ≤2.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (Q1/3W) or <1.75 mg/kg twice every 3 weeks (Q2/3W). The primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. ROR1 protein expression was correlated with clinical outcomes.\n\nResults:\n\nA total of 102 participants were enrolled (Q1/3W, *n* = 70; Q2/3W, *n* = 32). The objective response rate was 1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0%–8%] with Q1/3W dosing (one partial response, hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative breast cancer cohort) and 0% with Q2/3W dosing. The median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 2.3 (2.0–4.1) and 1.9 (1.7–2.1) months, respectively; the median overall survival (95% CI) was 8.3 (5.2–10.3) and 5.5 (4.4–11.0) months, respectively. Across dosing regimens, treatment-related adverse events were reported in 85 participants (83%), most commonly fatigue (29%) and nausea (28%). Treatment-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8%. Treatment-related adverse events led to dose interruption/reduction in 32 participants (31%) and permanent treatment discontinuation in 7 (7%). Tissue for ROR1 IHC was available on 17 participants, with only 3 (all nonresponders) showing ROR1 expression.\n\nConclusions:\n\nZilovertamab vedotin had minimal antitumor activity, with only a single responder, and manageable safety in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors.\n\nSignificance:\n\nZilovertamab vedotin had minimal antitumor activity and manageable safety in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors of various histologic subtypes. The results suggest that further development of zilovertamab vedotin in these solid tumors is not warranted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that shares homology with other receptor tyrosine kinases and shows high evolutionary conservation ([1](javascript:;), [2](javascript:;)). High levels of *ROR1* gene and protein expression have been reported in multiple solid tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinomas, as well as in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies ([3](javascript:;)–[5](javascript:;)). The activation of ROR1 has been associated with signaling pathways that are conducive to tumor growth, which has attracted interest as a potential anticancer target ([6](javascript:;)).\n\nZilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140) is an ROR1-targeting antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) composed of zilovertamab conjugated to vedotin, which is a combination of the linker maleimidocaproyl–valine–citrulline–para–aminobenzoate and the antimicrotubule cytotoxin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE; ref. [7](javascript:;)). The anticancer activity of zilovertamab vedotin is primarily due to binding of the ADC to ROR1-expressing tumor cells, internalization of the ADC–ROR1 complex with trafficking to tumor cell lysosomes, and release of MMAE via lysosomal proteolytic cleavage ([8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;)). The binding of free MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the tumor cell, inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic tumor cell death ([8](javascript:;)).\n\nIn preclinical studies, the humanized IgG1 mAb zilovertamab (previously known as UC-961 or cirmtuzumab) inhibited proliferation of ovarian and endometrial cancer cells ([10](javascript:;), [11](javascript:;)). Preclinical findings also showed that zilovertamab vedotin induced tumor shrinkage in mouse models of human lymphoid cancers ([8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;), [12](javascript:;)). In a phase 1 study, zilovertamab (doses ranging from 15 µg/kg to 20 mg/kg) inhibited ROR1 signaling in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; none of the 22 evaluable participants achieved a complete or partial response, although participants experienced a greater trend for reduction in disease burden with higher doses of zilovertamab ([13](javascript:;)). Preliminary findings in participants with relapsed or refractory non–Hodgkin lymphoma demonstrated that zilovertamab vedotin 2.5 mg/kg had a tolerable safety profile and promising antitumor activity [objective response rate (ORR), 30%–42%; refs. [7](javascript:;),[14](javascript:;),[15](javascript:;)], with exposure-dependent targeting of ROR1 ([16](javascript:;)). There are no reports on the use of zilovertamab vedotin monotherapy in participants with solid tumors. This phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of zilovertamab vedotin in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nThe study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04504916) was conducted according to International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and followed all local laws and regulations. The protocol (MK-2140-002) and associated amendments were reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board or independent Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedures were performed.\n\n### Participants\n\nEligible participants were ages ≥18 years, with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer, nonsquamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Other key inclusion criteria were metastatic disease that progressed during or following previous treatment, radiographically measurable disease as determined by the investigator, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, an available pretreatment tumor tissue biopsy (fresh or archival), completion of all previous anticancer therapy ≥2 weeks before the start of study treatment, life expectancy of ≥3 months from enrollment, and adequate organ function. Major exclusion criteria included grade >1 peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system malignancy, another major cancer with disease manifestations or therapy that could adversely affect participant safety or compromise interpretation of study results, uncontrolled ongoing infection, significant cardiovascular disease, and liver cirrhosis. Central ROR1 expression was not a prerequisite to participating in the study.\n\n### Design and treatment\n\nIn this phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm, multisite study, the initial starting dose of zilovertamab vedotin was 2.5 mg/kg administered intravenously on day 1 of repeated 21-day cycles [once every 3 weeks (Q1/3W)]. However, emerging serum pharmacokinetic data in participants with hematologic malignancies indicated that the ADC was eliminated quickly [elimination half-life (t1/2), ∼4 days] and high levels of receptor occupancy could not be maintained for the duration of the 3-week cycle. Similar findings were observed based on preliminary serum pharmacokinetic data in participants with solid tumors. The initial starting dose of zilovertamab vedotin was therefore altered via a protocol amendment to 1.75 mg/kg intravenous dosing (1.5 mg/kg intravenously for participants concurrently receiving a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) on days 1 and 8 of repeated 21-day cycles (Q2/3W; Supplementary Table S1), aiming for greater tumor exposure. There were plans to increase the initial starting dose via another protocol amendment to 2.0 mg/kg for the Q2/3W regimen, but the amendment was not activated, and participants never enrolled at this dose because of study termination. Dosing modifications were permitted based on toxicities. Study treatment continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent illness, investigator decision, noncompliance, or participant withdrawal of consent. The study design is depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1.\n\n### Endpoints and assessments\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study was the confirmed ORR per RECIST (RRID: SCR\\_026435) version 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). For this endpoint, participants had to achieve a complete or partial response that was confirmed ≥4 weeks after the first indication of a response was observed. Tumor burden was assessed by medical imaging, preferably using CT or MRI, at screening, every 9 weeks up to 36 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nSecondary endpoints included confirmed ORR per RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), safety, and pharmacokinetics. TTR was defined as the interval from the initiation of zilovertamab vedotin to the first documentation of objective tumor response. DOR was defined as the interval between the first documentation of objective tumor response and progressive disease or death from any cause. PFS was the interval from the initiation of zilovertamab vedotin to the first documentation of progressive disease or death from any cause. TTF was the interval from the initiation of zilovertamab vedotin to the first documentation of progressive disease, permanent discontinuation of zilovertamab vedotin because of an adverse event (AE), or death from any cause. OS was defined as the interval from the initiation of zilovertamab vedotin to death of any cause. AEs were monitored throughout the study and for 30 days after treatment and were graded by the investigator according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (RRID: SCR\\_010296) version 5.0. Pharmacokinetic endpoints included maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), t1/2, and area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) as calculated using noncompartmental methods for total zilovertamab vedotin, total antibody, and MMAE. Samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were obtained during cycle 1. In participants receiving Q1/3W dosing, samples were obtained before dosing, at the end of infusion, and at 2, 4, 168, 336, and 504 (predose in cycle 2) hours after the day 1 infusion. In participants receiving Q2/3W dosing, samples were obtained before dosing and at 0.5 and 168 hours after the day 1 infusion and before dosing and at 0.5, 168, and 336 (predose in cycle 2) hours after the day 8 infusion.\n\n### Sample collection and IHC analysis\n\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded pretreatment tumor tissue was collected from either a fresh tumor biopsy or an archival sample obtained since the last prior treatment and within 24 weeks before the start of study treatment. No posttreatment biopsies were requested or obtained. Due to the limited ORR and the availability of biospecimens, two cohorts were empirically created to represent participants with shorter and longer durations of treatment. The short treatment cohort was defined as participants who progressed at the first interval tumor assessment (9-week on-study radiology assessment after three cycles of treatment), and the longer treatment cohort was defined as participants who remained on study treatment for at least six cycles of therapy.\n\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples sectioned at 5 µm were baked at 60°C for 45 minutes and deparaffinized in a xylene to alcohol to water gradient using the Leica Autostainer XL (Leica Biosystems). Sections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in Target Retrieval Solution (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8.0, for ROR1 and Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.1, for marker of proliferation Ki-67) at 120°C for 4 minutes at 10 to 15 psi. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubating the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. The following staining procedure was performed in the Autostainer 480S (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slides were incubated with the primary antibody, rabbit anti-human ROR1 clone (S67H1L31, Roche Tissue Diagnostics, 7 µg/mL), or mouse anti-human Ki-67 clone (M7240, Dako, 0.7 µg/mL) for 60 minutes. The ROR1 clone chosen was the best performing from several rounds of custom antibody generation and assessment of numerous commercially available clones. Slides were then incubated with a secondary antibody (Envision rabbit horseradish peroxidase for ROR1 and Envision mouse horseradish peroxidase for Ki-67) for 30 minutes. Slides were rinsed in TBS with Tween 20 between each staining step. 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen was used to visualize antibody binding, and an enhancer was used for ROR1 to increase the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine signal. Stained slides were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin solution and bluing reagent and then cover-slipped for review by a pathologist.\n\nROR1 and Ki-67 protein expression in tumor tissues detected by IHC staining were analyzed and scored by a pathologist using the *H*-score system (score, 0–300) that was calculated using the following formula: *H*-score = (percentage of tumor cells stained at weak staining intensity + percentage of tumor cells stained at moderate intensity × 2 + percentage of tumor cells stained at strong intensity × 3) × 100. Both cytoplasmic and membranous staining patterns were considered.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nIt was estimated that approximately 30 participants per disease cohort would need to be accrued for enrollment to proceed through both stages of the Simon 2-stage enrollment paradigm for that cohort, with allowance for five additional participants (approximately 35 total per cohort), as some participants may not be fully evaluable for efficacy. Based on this design, the study had >0.80 power with a significance level of <0.05 when the ORR of a null hypothesis was 5% and the true ORR was 20% for each disease cohort. Efficacy and safety analyses included all participants who received ≥1 dose of zilovertamab vedotin. Pharmacokinetic analyses included all participants who received ≥1 dose of zilovertamab vedotin. ORR point estimates were calculated for each tumor type and dosing schedule together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the exact binomial method. Time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier with appropriate censoring. The opportunity to conduct an interim analysis was allowed at the sponsor’s discretion, and data were examined on a continuous basis to allow for dose-finding decisions. For each disease cohort, a futility interim analysis was conducted after the first 13 participants had their end-of-cycle 6 radiographic evaluation, without a pause in enrollment.\n\n### Data availability\n\nMerck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD), is committed to providing qualified scientific researchers access to anonymized data and clinical study reports from the company’s clinical trials for the purpose of conducting legitimate scientific research. MSD is also obligated to protect the rights and privacy of trial participants and, as such, has a procedure in place for evaluating and fulfilling requests for sharing company clinical trial data with qualified external scientific researchers. The MSD data-sharing website (available at <https://externaldatasharing-msd.com/>) outlines the process and requirements for submitting a data request. Applications will be promptly assessed for completeness and policy compliance. Feasible requests will be reviewed by a committee of MSD subject matter experts to assess the scientific validity of the request and the qualifications of the requestors. In line with data privacy legislation, submitters of approved requests must enter into a standard data-sharing agreement with MSD before data access is granted. Data will be made available for request after product approval in the United States and European Union or after product development is discontinued. There are circumstances that may prevent MSD from sharing requested data, including country- or region-specific regulations. If the request is declined, it will be communicated to the investigator. Access to genetic or exploratory biomarker data requires a detailed, hypothesis-driven statistical analysis plan that is collaboratively developed by the requestor and MSD subject matter experts; after approval of the statistical analysis plan and execution of a data-sharing agreement, MSD will either perform the proposed analyses and share the results with the requestor or construct biomarker covariates and add them to a file with clinical data that is uploaded to an analysis portal so that the requestor can perform the proposed analyses.\n\n## Results\n\n### Participants\n\nA total of 102 participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors were enrolled in the study (Supplementary Fig. S2). Of these participants, 70 (69%) received Q1/3W dosing and 32 (31%) received Q2/3W dosing. At data cutoff (November 15, 2023), all participants had discontinued treatment and long-term follow-up. Participant demographics and baseline characteristics are shown by dosing schedule and cancer type in [Table 1](javascript:;). Overall, participants had received a median of 4 (range, 1–21) prior systemic treatment regimens in both the primary and metastatic setting. The median age was 60 (range, 32–88) years, 38% of participants were ages ≥65 years, and the median body mass index was 26.1 (range, 15.6–36.3) kg/m2. Most participants were female (86%); 74% were White, 12% were Asian, 8% were Black or African American, and 6% were of other or unknown races. Sixty-six percent of participants had an ECOG performance status of 1. The study population was generally representative of the real-world setting in locations where participants were enrolled (Supplementary Table S2). During the study, participants received a median of 3 (range, 1–18) doses of zilovertamab vedotin over a median of 3 (range, 1–16) cycles. The median follow-up duration was 5.2 (range, 0.4–29.2) months. Study drug exposure and follow-up duration by dosing schedule and cancer type are shown in Supplementary Table S3.\n\nTable 1.\n\nParticipant demographics and baseline characteristics.\n\n| ​ . | Q1/3W . | Q2/3W . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TNBC (*n* = 15) . | HR+/HER2− (*n* = 35) . | NSCLC (*n* = 20) . | TNBC (*n* = 11) . | NSCLC (*n* = 9) . | Ovarian (*n* = 3) . | Pancreatic (*n* = 9) . |\n| Age, years | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| Median (range) | 49 (32–65) | 57 (33–75) | 71.5 (45–82) | 58 (35–70) | 68 (49–88) | 61 (43–74) | 64 (55–78) |\n| ≥65, *n* (%) | 1 (7) | 11 (31) | 13 (65) | 2 (18) | 7 (78) | 1 (33) | 4 (44) |\n| Sex, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| Female | 15 (100) | 34 (97) | 15 (75) | 11 (100) | 7 (78) | 3 (100) | 3 (33) |\n| Male | 0 | 1 (3) | 5 (25) | 0 | 2 (22) | 0 | 6 (67) |\n| Race, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| White | 9 (60) | 21 (60) | 16 (80) | 9 (82) | 9 (100) | 3 (100) | 8 (89) |\n| Asian | 3 (20) | 8 (23) | 0 | 1 (9) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Black or African American | 1 (7) | 4 (11) | 2 (10) | 1 (9) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| American Indian or Alaskan Native | 1 (7) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Other | 0 | 1 (3) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) |\n| Unknown | 1 (7) | 1 (3) | 2 (10) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| BMI, median (range), kg/m2 | 25.6 (19.8–33.8) | 25.8 (18.5–33.6) | 25.2 (17–35.7) | 26.3 (21.6–36.3) | 25.8 (18.2–35.9) | 28.7 (23.5–28.8) | 26.5 (15.6–33.5) |\n| ECOG performance status, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| 0 | 7 (47) | 13 (37) | 3 (15) | 5 (45) | 1 (11) | 1 (33) | 1 (11) |\n| 1 | 8 (53) | 21 (60) | 15 (75) | 6 (55) | 8 (89) | 2 (67) | 7 (78) |\n| 2 | 0 | 1 (3) | 2 (10) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Missing | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) |\n\n| ​ . | Q1/3W . | Q2/3W . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TNBC (*n* = 15) . | HR+/HER2− (*n* = 35) . | NSCLC (*n* = 20) . | TNBC (*n* = 11) . | NSCLC (*n* = 9) . | Ovarian (*n* = 3) . | Pancreatic (*n* = 9) . |\n| Age, years | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| Median (range) | 49 (32–65) | 57 (33–75) | 71.5 (45–82) | 58 (35–70) | 68 (49–88) | 61 (43–74) | 64 (55–78) |\n| ≥65, *n* (%) | 1 (7) | 11 (31) | 13 (65) | 2 (18) | 7 (78) | 1 (33) | 4 (44) |\n| Sex, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| Female | 15 (100) | 34 (97) | 15 (75) | 11 (100) | 7 (78) | 3 (100) | 3 (33) |\n| Male | 0 | 1 (3) | 5 (25) | 0 | 2 (22) | 0 | 6 (67) |\n| Race, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| White | 9 (60) | 21 (60) | 16 (80) | 9 (82) | 9 (100) | 3 (100) | 8 (89) |\n| Asian | 3 (20) | 8 (23) | 0 | 1 (9) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Black or African American | 1 (7) | 4 (11) | 2 (10) | 1 (9) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| American Indian or Alaskan Native | 1 (7) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Other | 0 | 1 (3) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) |\n| Unknown | 1 (7) | 1 (3) | 2 (10) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| BMI, median (range), kg/m2 | 25.6 (19.8–33.8) | 25.8 (18.5–33.6) | 25.2 (17–35.7) | 26.3 (21.6–36.3) | 25.8 (18.2–35.9) | 28.7 (23.5–28.8) | 26.5 (15.6–33.5) |\n| ECOG performance status, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| 0 | 7 (47) | 13 (37) | 3 (15) | 5 (45) | 1 (11) | 1 (33) | 1 (11) |\n| 1 | 8 (53) | 21 (60) | 15 (75) | 6 (55) | 8 (89) | 2 (67) | 7 (78) |\n| 2 | 0 | 1 (3) | 2 (10) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Missing | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) |\n\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; Q1/3W, dosing on day 1 of repeated 21-day cycles; Q2/3W, dosing on days 1 and 8 of repeated 21-day cycles.\n\n[View large](/view-large/16350437)\n\n### Efficacy\n\nEfficacy results by dosing schedule and cancer type are shown in [Table 2](javascript:;) (BICR) and Supplementary Table S4 (investigator assessment). Swimmer plots are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 (BICR) and Supplementary Fig. S4 (investigator assessment). The confirmed ORRs per either BICR or investigator assessment were 1% (95% CI, 0%–8%) with 1 partial response in participants receiving Q1/3W dosing and 0% in participants receiving Q2/3W dosing. No confirmed complete responses were observed. The confirmed partial response occurred in a participant with HR+/HER2− breast cancer with liver and bone metastases at screening, an ECOG performance status of 0, and 4 prior lines of therapy (including a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy); TTR was 1.9 months per both BICR and investigator assessment, and OS was 24 months. Per investigator assessment, this participant had a DOR of 4.2 months and TTF and PFS of 6.0 months but was censored per BICR assessment (BICR considered this participant to have had an ongoing response at the last scan before data cutoff).\n\nTable 2.\n\nSummary of efficacy results[a](javascript:;).\n\n| ​ . | Q1/3W . | Q2/3W . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TNBC (*n* = 15) . | HR+/HER2−(*n* = 35) . | NSCLC (*n* = 20) . | TNBC (*n* = 11) . | NSCLC (*n* = 9) . | Ovarian (*n* = 3) . | Pancreatic (*n* = 9) . |\n| Confirmed ORR (95% CI), % | 0 | 3 (0–15) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| BOR, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| CR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| PR | 0 | 1 (3) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| SD | 7 (47) | 14 (40) | 7 (35) | 5 (45) | 4 (44) | 0 | 0 |\n| PD | 3 (20) | 13 (37) | 7 (35) | 6 (55) | 2 (22) | 1 (33) | 6 (67) |\n| Not evaluable | 3 (20) | 2 (6) | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) | 2 (67) | 1 (11) |\n| No assessment | 2 (13) | 5 (14) | 6 (30) | 0 | 2 (22) | 0 | 2 (22) |\n| PFS, median (95% CI), months | 3.8 (1.4–NA) | 3.1 (1.9–4.2) | 2.2 (1.5–4.6) | 2.1 (1.4–4.2) | 4.3 (1.6–NA) | 1.9 (1.3–NA) | 1.7 (1.4–NA) |\n| TTF, median (95% CI), months | 3.8 (1.2–NA) | 3.1 (1.9–4.2) | 2.2 (1.4–4.6) | 2.1 (1.4–4.2) | 4.3 (1.6–NA) | 1.9 (1.3–NA) | 1.7 (1.4–NA) |\n| OS, median (95% CI), months | 9.5 (3.6–11.6) | 10.7 (5.2–16.4) | 5.4 (2.9–8.3) | 5 (4–NA) | 8.9 (1.8–NA) | 8.1 (1.3–NA) | 5 (1.4–NA) |\n\n| ​ . | Q1/3W . | Q2/3W . |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TNBC (*n* = 15) . | HR+/HER2−(*n* = 35) . | NSCLC (*n* = 20) . | TNBC (*n* = 11) . | NSCLC (*n* = 9) . | Ovarian (*n* = 3) . | Pancreatic (*n* = 9) . |\n| Confirmed ORR (95% CI), % | 0 | 3 (0–15) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| BOR, *n* (%) | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ |\n| CR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| PR | 0 | 1 (3) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| SD | 7 (47) | 14 (40) | 7 (35) | 5 (45) | 4 (44) | 0 | 0 |\n| PD | 3 (20) | 13 (37) | 7 (35) | 6 (55) | 2 (22) | 1 (33) | 6 (67) |\n| Not evaluable | 3 (20) | 2 (6) | 0 | 0 | 1 (11) | 2 (67) | 1 (11) |\n| No assessment | 2 (13) | 5 (14) | 6 (30) | 0 | 2 (22) | 0 | 2 (22) |\n| PFS, median (95% CI), months | 3.8 (1.4–NA) | 3.1 (1.9–4.2) | 2.2 (1.5–4.6) | 2.1 (1.4–4.2) | 4.3 (1.6–NA) | 1.9 (1.3–NA) | 1.7 (1.4–NA) |\n| TTF, median (95% CI), months | 3.8 (1.2–NA) | 3.1 (1.9–4.2) | 2.2 (1.4–4.6) | 2.1 (1.4–4.2) | 4.3 (1.6–NA) | 1.9 (1.3–NA) | 1.7 (1.4–NA) |\n| OS, median (95% CI), months | 9.5 (3.6–11.6) | 10.7 (5.2–16.4) | 5.4 (2.9–8.3) | 5 (4–NA) | 8.9 (1.8–NA) | 8.1 (1.3–NA) | 5 (1.4–NA) |\n\nAbbreviations: BOR, best overall response; CR, complete response; NA, not available; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; Q1/3W, dosing on day 1 of repeated 21-day cycles; Q2/3W, dosing on days 1 and 8 of repeated 21-day cycles; SD, stable disease.\n\na\n\nResponses, PFS, and TTF are per RECIST version 1.1 by BICR.\n\n[View large](/view-large/16350440)\n\nThe median PFS per BICR was 2.3 (95% CI, 2.0–4.1) months with Q1/3W dosing and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.1) months with Q2/3W dosing.

All 102 participants experienced AEs. Serious AEs occurred in 29 participants (41%) receiving Q1/3W dosing and 16 (50%) receiving Q2/3W dosing, and treatment-related AEs occurred in 58 participants (83%) and 27 participants (84%), respectively. Overall, serious AEs considered to be related to the study drug occurred in 16 participants (16%). The most common treatment-related AEs (occurring in ≥20% of participants with either dosing schedule) were fatigue (30% with Q1/3W dosing and 28% with Q2/3W dosing), nausea (27% and 31%, respectively), diarrhea (23% and 13%), alopecia (17% and 22%), decreased neutrophil count (16% and 22%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (23% and 6%). Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs were reported in 21 participants (30%) receiving Q1/3W dosing and 12 (38%) receiving Q2/3W dosing. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs (occurring in ≥10% of participants with either dosing schedule) were decreased neutrophil count (14% with Q1/3W dosing and 16% with Q2/3W dosing) and fatigue (4% and 13%, respectively).

The most common treatment-related events leading to dose interruption or reduction (occurring in ≥5% of participants with either dosing schedule) were decreased neutrophil count (1% with Q1/3W dosing and 19% with Q2/3W dosing), fatigue (3% and 9%, respectively), and peripheral neuropathy (3% and 9%). Treatment-related AEs led to permanent discontinuation of zilovertamab vedotin in five participants (7%) receiving Q1/3W dosing and 2 (6%) receiving Q2/3W dosing. Peripheral neuropathy was the only treatment-related AE to result in the permanent discontinuation of study drug in >1 participant [0 with Q1/3W dosing and 2 (6%) with Q2/3W dosing].\n\n### Pharmacokinetics\n\nIn participants who received Q1/3W dosing, the mean AUC0–504h was 6,720 hours•µg/mL for total antibody, 4,030 hours•µg/mL for total ADC, and 0.828 hours•µg/mL for MMAE (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figs. S5–S7). The mean Cmax was 51.2 µg/mL, 53.4 µg/mL, and 0.00393 µg/mL, respectively. The Tmax of MMAE was delayed in comparison with total ADC (165.43 vs. 2.38 hours). The t1/2s for total antibody, total ADC, and MMAE were 6.89, 4.19, and 3.57 days, respectively. The geometric mean ratio of the AUC of total ADC to total antibody was 0.63.\n\nIn participants treated with Q2/3W dosing, the mean AUC0–504h was 7,770 hours•µg/mL for total antibody (an approximate 16% increase vs. Q1/3W dosing), 4,900 hours•µg/mL for total ADC (an approximate 22% increase vs. Q1/3W dosing), and 0.684 hours•µg/mL for MMAE (an approximate 17% decrease vs. Q1/3W dosing; Supplementary Table S6; Supplementary Figs. S8–S10). The mean Cmax of MMAE was lower with Q2/3W dosing (0.00121 µg/mL on day 1, 0.00289 µg/mL on day 8) compared with Q1/3W dosing (0.00393 µg/mL). As observed with Q1/3W dosing, the Tmax of MMAE on day 8 of cycle 1 was also delayed in comparison with total ADC (142.58 vs. 0.58 hours) with Q2/3W dosing.\n\n### Expression–response relationships\n\nIHC analyses were performed on a subset of 34 non-TNBC participants and 27 participants with NSCLC from the 88 participants who had been treated at the time of evaluation. Participants with TNBC (*n* = 21) were excluded because none were in the longer treatment cohort. Participants with other tumor types (*n* = 6) were excluded because of small numbers at the time of evaluation. Non-TNBC participants and participants with NSCLC who were receiving ongoing treatment for <6 cycles at the time of biospecimen identification, or who discontinued treatment before the first interval tumor assessment, were excluded because treatment cohort could not be assigned (*n* = 30). Of the 31 remaining participants, 19 had tumor blocks available that were selected for processing. Of these 19 biospecimens, 17 (89%) had sufficient tumor content to perform IHC analyses. Eight participants with assessable biospecimens had a short duration of treatment, and nine participants had a long duration of treatment. The mean *H*-score for ROR1 was 6 (95% CI, 0–14), and the median was 0 (range, 0–65). Three participants had non-zero *H*-scores (10, 30, and 65) with no clear difference between the short and longer treated cohorts (Supplementary Table S7).\n\nThe mean Ki-67 *H*-score was 84 (95% CI, 57–100), and the median was 80 (range, 0–195). No clear difference in Ki-67 *H*-score between the short and longer treated cohorts was observed [Supplementary Table S7; mean, 79 (short) and 88 (longer)].\n\n## Discussion\n\nZilovertamab vedotin demonstrated limited antitumor activity in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors. During the study, 1 of 70 participants treated with Q1/3W dosing achieved a partial response for a confirmed ORR of 1% (95% CI, 0%–8%) per RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by BICR (primary endpoint). No complete responses were observed. The confirmed ORR among the 32 participants treated with Q2/3W dosing was 0%. Investigator-assessed findings corroborated the BICR results. Zilovertamab vedotin had a manageable safety and tolerability profile, regardless of the dosing schedule, with 16% of participants experiencing treatment-related serious AEs. Pharmacokinetic results suggested potential benefits with Q2/3W dosing compared with Q1/3W dosing.\n\nThe low confirmed ORR is in contrast with the results in participants with relapsed or refractory non–Hodgkin lymphoma. In the phase 1, dose-escalation waveLINE-001 study ([7](javascript:;), [14](javascript:;)), the ORR was 37% (95% CI, 22%–53%) with 5 complete responses and 10 partial responses among 41 participants treated with zilovertamab vedotin up to 2.5 mg/kg Q1/3W ([7](javascript:;)). The median DOR among these 15 responders was 7.8 (range, 2.1–17.6+) months ([7](javascript:;)). No responses were seen in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (*n* = 7) or acute myeloid leukemia (*n* = 3; ref. [14](javascript:;)). Preliminary results from the phase 2 waveLINE-004 study indicated an ORR of 30% (95% CI, 12%–54%), with 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses among 20 evaluable participants with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ([15](javascript:;)). All participants in that study were treated with zilovertamab vedotin 2.5 mg/kg Q1/3W. Correlations with ROR1 protein expression were not reported in either study. Differences in antitumor activity between our study and the previous studies may be related to the cancer types enrolled. Our study included cancer types that are among the most aggressive and difficult to treat. Five-year survival rates upon diagnosis of metastatic disease are only approximately 3% for pancreatic cancer, 8% for lung cancer, and 30% for breast and ovarian cancers compared with 70% for non–Hodgkin lymphoma ([17](javascript:;)). ADC responses to solid and hematologic malignancies vary based on target expression, tissue penetration, and tumor lineage.\n\nThe types of AEs observed in our study were consistent with those reported in participants with non–Hodgkin lymphoma ([14](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)) and with other vedotin-based ADCs ([18](javascript:;), [19](javascript:;)). In our study, the most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (29% overall), nausea (28%), and diarrhea (20%). Small differences between the dosing regimens were observed in the proportions of participants who experienced serious AEs (50% with Q2/3W dosing vs. 41% with Q1/3W dosing), grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs (38% vs. 30%), and treatment-related AEs leading to interruption or dose reduction (38% vs. 29%). Rates of AEs leading to interruption or dose reduction were comparable to those observed with other ADCs in participants with solid tumors, including trastuzumab deruxtecan ([20](javascript:;)), sacituzumab govitecan ([21](javascript:;)), and the investigational agent YL201 ([22](javascript:;)). In the study of trastuzumab deruxtecan, treatment-related AEs led to interruption or dose reduction in 85 of 267 (32%) participants ([20](javascript:;)). Rates of permanent discontinuation of zilovertamab vedotin in our study were similar in participants receiving Q1/3W dosing (7%) compared with Q2/3W dosing (6%), suggesting manageable toxicity with both dosing schedules. Two treatment-related AEs were fatal, as described previously.\n\nPharmacokinetic analyses showed that Q2/3W dosing, compared with Q1/3W dosing, resulted in higher ADC exposure over the 3-week interval and lower Cmax and AUC values for MMAE. This suggests that Q2/3W dosing has the potential to maximize target engagement via ADC binding to ROR1-expressing tumor cells without increasing MMAE-related toxicities. Additionally, Q2/3W dosing is advantageous considering the short t1/2 of ADC seen with Q1/3W dosing. The Cmax of MMAE associated with Q2/3W dosing in our study was lower than ([23](javascript:;), [24](javascript:;)) or similar to ([25](javascript:;)) those reported with the approved doses of other vedotin-based ADCs.\n\nTranslational studies were limited by the small sample size with available tissue. In participants with samples available, we did not identify expression–response relationships associated with either ROR1 or Ki-67 protein expression as measured by IHC and clinical outcomes. It is notable that the trial did not select for ROR1 expression and that ROR1 expression was noted in only 3 of 17 participants with adequate tissue. This is consistent with recent data indicating that many tumor types have low prevalence of ROR1 expression, whereas in some others, such as mesothelioma, it is more frequent ([26](javascript:;)). Prospectively selecting participants or tumor subtypes for ROR1 expression could result in higher antitumor activity.\n\nA limitation of our study was the small sample size, particularly for the ovarian and pancreatic cohorts. The pharmacokinetic differences seen with Q1/3W versus Q2/3W dosing did not seem to translate into any apparent differences in efficacy or safety in our study, although tumor types varied substantially between dosing schedules. All participants were treated with monotherapy and had previously treated metastatic disease. It is unknown whether initiating zilovertamab vedotin earlier or combining it with complementary agents might have improved antitumor activity.\n\nOur study of zilovertamab vedotin monotherapy reports on an ADC targeting ROR1 for the treatment of participants with advanced solid tumors. In addition, ongoing phase 2/3 studies of zilovertamab vedotin are assessing monotherapy and combination therapy approaches in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [NCT05139017 ([27](javascript:;)) and NCT05406401 ([28](javascript:;)) and select aggressive and indolent B-cell malignancies NCT05458297 ([29](javascript:;))]. Other first-in-human studies evaluating ADCs targeting ROR1 for the treatment of participants with advanced solid tumors have been initiated ([30](javascript:;), [31](javascript:;)). The NBE-002 study [NCT04441099 ([30](javascript:;))] was stopped early after enrolling 12 of a planned 100 participants. The sponsor terminated the program, and the results have yet to be presented or published. In this regard, it is important to note that NBE-002 includes the potent anthracycline derivative PNU-159682 as its cytotoxic payload in contrast to MMAE for zilovertamab vedotin ([32](javascript:;)). Further study is needed to determine whether the cytotoxic payload rather than targeting ROR1 is responsible for any associated ADC toxicity. Choice of cytotoxic payload is likely to play an important role in the safety profile of ADCs ([33](javascript:;)). The CS5001 study [NCT05279300 ([30](javascript:;))] is currently recruiting and has a planned enrollment of 156 participants with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. The results are expected in 2025.\n\nIn conclusion, zilovertamab vedotin had minimal antitumor activity, with only a single responder in participants with previously treated metastatic solid tumors of various histologic subtypes. Safety was generally manageable with dose interruption or reduction. The results suggest that further development of zilovertamab vedotin in these solid tumors is not warranted.\n\n## Authors’ Disclosures\n\nF.
