It has had wide use as a chemotherapeutic agent since the 1960s. Doxorubicin is part of the anthracycline group of chemotherapeutic agents; other anthracyclines include daunorubicin, idarubicin, and epirubicin.

Doxorubicin may be used to treat soft tissue and bone sarcomas and cancers of the breast, ovary, bladder, and thyroid.

The liposomal formulation of doxorubicin has FDA approval for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients who have failed platinum-based chemotherapy, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, and multiple myeloma.[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nMechanism of Action\n-------------------\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of doxorubicin involves the drug’s ability to intercalate within DNA base pairs, causing breakage of DNA strands and inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis. Doxorubicin inhibits the enzyme topoisomerase II, causing DNA damage and induction of apoptosis. When combined with iron, doxorubicin also causes free radical-mediated oxidative damage to DNA, further limiting DNA synthesis.

The drug is easily recognizable in its liquid form due to its highly pigmented, reddish appearance. Doxorubicin is incompatible with heparin and fluorouracil and can cause precipitation if mixed with these drugs. While doxorubicin may be administered rapidly (over 15 to 20 minutes), slow administration of the liposomal formulation is recommended to reduce the risk of infusion reactions. Doxorubicin should be stored in a refrigerated area and re from light before administration. Doxorubicin exhibits rapid distribution into tissues and has an elimination half-life of up to 48 hours. Doxorubicin undergoes enzymatic reduction and requires protection undergoes elimination through biliary excretion.[[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n**Adult dosing by indication:**\n\nAxillary node-positive breast cancer as an adjuvant:\n\n*   60 mg/m^2 IV once on the first day of a 21-day cycle.

Bone marrow suppression and an increased risk of secondary malignancy diagnoses may occur. Doxorubicin extravasation during intravenous administration can result in severe tissue ulceration and necrosis, which worsens over time.Doxorubicin is also associated with significant cardiac toxicity, which limits the long-term use of the drug. The mechanism of action of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity differs from the drug’s antitumor mechanism. It involves increased oxidative stress, down-regulation of cardiac-specific genes, and induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis by doxorubicin. The acute cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin occurs within days of the drug’s administration and occurs in approximately 11% of patients who receive the drug.\n\nAcute cardiac toxicity manifests as reversible myopericarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, or arrhythmias. Doxorubicin-related arrhythmias occur in up to 26% of patients who receive the therapy and can include sinus tachycardia, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia. Rarely, acute left ventricular dysfunction can occur after doxorubicin administration; this condition is reversible. Chronic, late cardiac toxicity may also occur after doxorubicin administration and is the most serious and potentially lethal adverse effect associated with doxorubicin therapy. The incidence of chronic doxorubicin cardiac toxicity is approximately 1.7%.\n\nDoxorubicin-induced irreversible cardiomyopathy occurs within a few months of the end of treatment but has also been reported to occur up to twenty years after treatment termination. Congestive heart failure may also occur. Risk factors for doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure include a higher cumulative drug dose, extremes of age, combination chemotherapy with other cardiotoxic drugs, pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and previous radiation to the mediastinal region. When congestive heart failure develops after doxorubicin administration, the 1-year mortality rate is approximately 50%.[[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nContraindications\n-----------------\n\nDoxorubicin is frequently listed as a contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). Animal studies of the combined administration of HBO and doxorubicin have shown different results, leading to controversy about whether HBO is contraindicated in patients receiving the drug.HBO was studied in 1985, along with the use of antioxidants, as a potential nonsurgical remedy for skin necrosis due to doxorubicin extravasation. In this study, researchers fed groups of rats antioxidants (beta-carotene and/or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a common food preservative and known free radical scavenger). Subsequently, the rats were anesthetized and injected intradermally with doxorubicin. Some rats were then exposed to HBO at 2.5 ATA after the doxorubicin injections. The rats that were fed BHT before doxorubicin injection exhibited improved wound healing. The group of rats that received HBO after doxorubicin injection experienced an 87% mortality rate, which the authors attributed to the formation of free radicals by both HBO and doxorubicin.\n\nWhile the results of this single study suggest that the concurrent administration of HBO and doxorubicin may be associated with increased mortality, subsequent studies have not demonstrated an increase in mortality or cardiac toxicity after administration of HBO and doxorubicin. The effects of HBO after remote doxorubicin administration are unknown. It may be safe to administer HBO after doxorubicin has been cleared from the body, in other words, after five to six elimination half-lives, or 12 days). Still, additional studies are necessary for further exploration of this topic.[[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nMonitoring\n----------\n\nBaseline (pre-treatment) and regular monitoring of cardiac function through echocardiography or multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA scan) are recommended for patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin. Patients who exhibit a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction during doxorubicin treatment should have the drug discontinued. Endomyocardial biopsy may also be utilized to diagnose doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy; findings include loss of myofibrils and cytoplasm vacuolization. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for patients diagnosed with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\nDiuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers are potential options, but these treatments do not improve the overall patient prognosis. Cardiac transplantation has been successful in some patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Since higher cumulative doxorubicin doses are a risk factor for the development of cardiomyopathy, dose limitation is advocated to reduce cardiotoxicity. Antioxidant drugs (including amlodipine and carvedilol) have been studied as potential preventive agents to reduce the incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane, an iron chelator, may be co-administered with doxorubicin to reduce the cardiotoxicity of the drug. However, the administration of dexrazoxane may induce myelosuppression, which can be potentiated by doxorubicin, so its clinical efficacy remains in question.[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nToxicity\n--------\n\nAs covered in the Monitoring section, doxorubicin has significant potential for cardiotoxicity, as with other anthracycline drugs.[[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n----------------------------------\n\nDoxorubicin is a frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many solid tumors and requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team to be effective. While the drug is effective, it does have one serious adverse effect.This team includes primary care clinicians who refer patients to the oncologist who will need to perform a cardiac screen test on patients with risk factors for heart disease. The oncology specialty nurses will assist in all aspects of care, work with the patient on regimen compliance, and answer questions. Pharmacists can also weigh in with dosing, medication reconciliation, and patient counseling. The reason is that doxorubicin can cause irreversible cardiomyopathy what may occur at any time after treatment. With this interprofessional approach, patients stand the best chance at a positive outcome while avoiding potential adverse effects. [Level 5]\n\nBaseline (pre-treatment) and regular monitoring of cardiac function through echocardiography or multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA scan) are recommended for patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin. The prescribing clinician would do well to include an oncology board-certified pharmacist Patients who exhibit a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction during doxorubicin treatment should have the drug discontinued.Oncology nurses can also be beneficial in verifying therapy effectiveness and watching for adverse events. Since higher cumulative doxorubicin doses are a risk factor for the development of cardiomyopathy, dose limitation is advocated to reduce cardiotoxicity.[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#)[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459232/#) These are a few examples of interprofessional collaboration to maximize therapeutic results.

This action causes inhibition of DNA synthesis and affects the activity of DNA topoisomerase II.[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)Anthracyclines can also form free radicals, which can target and damage rapidly growing cells.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\nDoxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Several clinically significant interactions have been reported with other inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or Pgp that can increase doxorubicin concentration, resulting in more or worsening side effects and toxicity at lower levels dosages.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nAdministration\n--------------\n\nDoxorubicin is available as a powder for injection or as a liquid solution [2 mg/mL] administered intravenously (IV) via a central line as a continuous infusion.[[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n**Adult Dosing**\n\n*   60 to 75 mg/m^2 intravenously (IV) every 21 days OR \n*   60 mg/m2 IV every 14 days OR \n*   40 to 60 mg/m^2 IV every 21 to 28 days OR \n*   20 mg/m^2/dose once/week \n\n**Pediatric Dosing**\n\n*   35 to 75 mg/m^2 intravenously (IV) every 21 days \n*   20 to 30 mg/m^2/dose once/week \n*   60 to 90 mg/m^2 IV over 96 hours every 3 to 4 weeks \n\n**Renal Impairment**\n\n*   No dosage adjustment is necessary \n\n**Hepatic Impairment**\n\n*   Total serum bilirubin less than 1.2 mg/dL: No dosage adjustment is necessary \n*   Total serum bilirubin 1.2 to 3.0 mg/dL: Decrease dose by 50% \n*   Total serum bilirubin: 3.1 to 5.0 mg/dL: Decrease dose by 25% \n*   Severe hepatic impairment: Contraindicated due to toxicity \n\nDue to the side effect profile and toxicity of doxorubicin, patients are only allowed a lifetime dose of 550 mg/m^2.Patients receiving doxorubicin therapy must receive close follow-up and monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and heart function studies.[[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nAdverse Effects\n---------------\n\n**Side Effects**[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n*   Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n*   Severe cough \n*   Photosensitivity \n*   Skin and nail hyperpigmentation \n*   Hoarseness of voice \n*   Flushing of the face \n*   Fatigue \n*   Joint pain \n*   Painful or difficult urination \n*   Persistent diarrhea \n\n**Less Common Side Effects**[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n*   Black/tarry or bloody stools \n*   Seizures \n*   Tissue necrosis or death \n*   Cardiac arrhythmias \n*   Anemia \n*   Neutropenia \n*   Shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure \n*   Edema in ankles or feet due to congestive heart failure \n*   A decrease in left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of greater than or equal to 10% \n*   Cardiomyopathy \n*   Hepatotoxicity \n*   Tumor lysis syndrome \n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nContraindications\n-----------------\n\n*   Previous allergic reaction or anaphylaxis \n*   Pregnancy or if planning to become pregnant (relative contraindication- should be used for cancer treatment during pregnancy when indicated as a first-line agent) \n*   Current active viral or bacterial infections \n*   Severe hepatic impairment and/or total serum bilirubin over 5.0 mg/dL \n*   Myocardial infarction within the last 30 days before treatment \n*   Prior treatment to a maximum dose of 550 mg/m^2 with doxorubicin or other anthracycline agents \n*   Systolic dysfunction/cardiomyopathy not optimized on medical therapy \n*   Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration \n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nMonitoring\n----------\n\nDue to the cardiotoxic profile of doxorubicin, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed and monitored routinely using an echocardiogram. An LVEF drop of greater than 10% from baseline is considered indicative of cardiotoxicity, and immediate intervention by physicians and the healthcare team is required. An alternative to echocardiogram monitoring is radionuclide ventriculography, such as multi-gated acquisition angiogram (MUGA) or equilibrium radionuclide angiogram (ERNA) scans, although less frequently used.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\nObtain baseline complete blood counts (CBC), hepatic enzymes, and tests of hepatic function.\n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nToxicity\n--------\n\nThe most prevalent toxicities appear below, as reported by several case studies and medication trials.[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[13]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)\n\n*   Cardiomyopathy/cardiotoxicity: The incidence of myocardial damage from doxorubicin ranges from 1% to 20%, with dosages above 300 mg/m2. LVEF is important to monitor before, during, and after doxorubicin treatment.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#) \n*   Secondary malignancies: Although used to treat various malignancies and tumors, doxorubicin and other anthracyclines are known for causing secondary malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). \n*   Tissue necrosis: doxorubicin extravasation can cause severe tissue death and necrosis requiring excision and grafting of the skin. It is important to monitor during intravenous injection or infusion of the agent. \n*   Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure is a strong contraindication to the use of doxorubicin. Trending total bilirubin concentrations and monitoring liver enzyme concentrations is essential. \n*   Myelosuppression: As with other anthracyclines, doxorubicin is known for causing severe myelosuppression requiring routine monitoring of white blood counts, hemoglobin, and platelets as myelosuppression predisposes to infections, sepsis, hospitalizations, or even death. \n\n**Toxicity Prevention**\n\n*   Several pharmacological agents have been used and studied to prevent and/or decrease cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracyclines, including dexrazoxane, beta-blockers, angiotensin antagonists, statins coenzyme Q-10, and N-acetylcysteine. Most notable studies have taken place testing beta-blockers and dexrazoxane. \n*   In one randomized study of 25 patients, carvedilol was not better than a placebo at preventing systolic and diastolic heart failure in patients taking anthracyclines.[[15]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#) \n*   Dexrazoxane is a prodrug and potent reversible inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, which may decrease topoisomerase II binding by doxorubicin and thus decrease the cytotoxicity of healthy cells. Dexrazoxane is an iron chelator (structurally similar to EDTA) that is thought to decrease free radicals generated by doxorubicin. \n*   A retrospective study found that dexrazoxane did not significantly affect the mean LVEF after anthracycline administration (56% with dexrazoxane vs. 53% without), but while the authors concluded that it decreased the rate of cardiac events, defined as a reduction of LVEF more than 10%, it is difficult to reconcile that conclusion of this retrospective analysis with the fact that the mean LVEF between the two groups was not different.[[16]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#) \n*   In a meta-analysis reviewing 16 trials, including 1918 patients: dexrazoxane reduced cardiotoxicity after anthracycline treatment by 33%. It specifically decreased heart failure by 58% compared to other agents, including beta-blockers, statins, coenzyme Q-10, and N-acetylcysteine. However, the study determined dexrazoxane did not affect the response rate of malignancies or the risk of death.[[17]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#) \n*   Further studies are in process and have begun to attract attention to minimize the cardiotoxicity risk of doxorubicin. \n\n[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/# \"Go to other sections in this page\")\n\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\n----------------------------------\n\nDoxorubicin has been a mainstay in treating various cancers for many years, and members of the interprofessional health care team must be aware and up to date on the indications, interaction, adverse effects, and other pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors that can affect successful therapy implementation, and lead to improved patient outcomes.\n\nPrescribing and monitoring doxorubicin requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), various specialists (e.g., cardiologist, and hematologist/oncologist), nursing staff with specialized oncology and chemotherapy training, laboratory technologists, and pharmacists (preferably also oncology specialized)all working collaboratively and engaging in open communication about the patient's progress, status, and response to treatment.\n\nProper monitoring for complications, particularly cardiac and hepatic, is indicated as a retrospective study reported cardiotoxicity in 26%, and the 1-year mortality with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is as high as 50%.[[18]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)[[19]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#)Research has also shown cardiotoxicity as the leading cause of death in patients taking anthracyclines, as seen by several extensive randomized clinical retrospective studies.[[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551633/#) [Level 1]\n\nRegularly monitor complete blood counts and metabolic panels to monitor for myelosuppression. The medical team should respond and assess significant changes to consider halting the drug when indicated. This monitoring function often falls to the clinical pharmacist, who will track the necessary lab work and inform the ordering clinician regarding situations that require alterations in the regimen. Nursing will be well versed in administration and monitoring for side effects, particularly extravasation, and inform the team of any concerns.\n\nTeam coordination is also necessary when considering using dexrazoxane to decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity.\n\nThis interprofessional paradigm leads to the best patient result for oncological care with doxorubicin while mitigating risks and preventing adverse events.

It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a doxorubicin(1+). It derives from a [hydride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydride) of a [tetracene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/tetracene).\n\nChEBI\n\nDoxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with [daunorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/daunorubicin), another cytotoxic agent, in 1970. Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the [methyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/methyl) group of [daunorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/daunorubicin). Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers. However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.\n\nDrugBank\n\nDoxorubicin is an Anthracycline Topoisomerase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of doxorubicin is as a Topoisomerase Inhibitor.\n\nFDA Pharm Classes\n\nView More...\n\n[See also](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Other-Relationships): [![Image 6](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?t=s&cid=443939)Doxorubicin Hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/443939) (active moiety of); [![Image 7](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?t=s&cid=9810709)Aldoxorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9810709) (active moiety of); [![Image 8](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?t=s&cid=16134409)Zoptarelin Doxorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16134409) (active moiety of) ...

7.1 Drug Indication[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Drug-Indication&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nDoxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of neoplastic conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic Wilms’ tumor, metastatic neuroblastoma, metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas, metastatic ovarian carcinoma, metastatic transitional cell bladder carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic gastric carcinoma, and metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma. Doxorubicin is also indicated for use as a component of adjuvant therapy in women with evidence of axillary lymph node involvement following resection of primary breast cancer. For the liposomal formulation, doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer that has progressed or recurred after [platinum](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Platinum)-based chemotherapy, AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma after the failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy, and multiple myeloma in combination with [bortezomib](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/bortezomib) in patients who have not previously received [bortezomib](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/bortezomib) and have received at least one prior therapy.\n\nDrugBank\n\n[FDA Label](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/drugbank/fda_labels/DB00997.pdf?1265922814)\n\nDrugBank\n\nZolsketil pegylated liposomal is a medicine used to treat the following types of cancer in adults: • breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in patients at risk of heart problems. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is used on its own for this disease; • advanced ovarian cancer in women whose previous treatment including a [platinum](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Platinum)-based cancer medicine has stopped working; • multiple myeloma (a cancer of the white blood cells in the bone marrow), in patients with progressive disease who have received at least one other treatment in the past and have already had, or are unsuitable for, a bone marrow transplantation. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is used in combination with [bortezomib](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/bortezomib) (another cancer medicine); • Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with AIDS who have a very damaged immune system. Kaposi's sarcoma is a cancer that causes abnormal tissue to grow under the skin, on moist body surfaces or on internal organs. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal contains the active substance doxorubicin and is a ‘hybrid medicine'. This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine' containing the same active substance called Adriamycin. However, in Zolsketil pegylated liposomal the active substance is enclosed in tiny fatty spheres called liposomes, whereas this is not the case for Adriamycin.\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency (EMA)\n\nView More...\n\n### 7.2 Drug Classes[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Drug-Classes&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nBreast Feeding; Lactation; Milk, Human; Antineoplastic Agents; Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Topoisomerase II Inhibitors \n\nDrugs and Lactation Database (LactMed)\n\n### 7.3 WHO Essential Medicines[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=WHO-Essential-Medicines&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nDrug\n\nDrug Classes\n\nFormulation\n\nIndication\n\nDrug\n\n[Doxorubicin](https://list.essentialmeds.org/medicines/87)\n\nDrug Classes\n\nCytotoxic medicines \n\nFormulation\n\n(1) Parenteral - General injections - IV: 10 mg in vial (hydrochloride); 50 mg in vial (hydrochloride); (2) Parenteral - General injections - IV: 10 mg in vial (hydrochloride) powder for injection; 50 mg in vial (hydrochloride) powder for injection; 2 mg per mL in 5 mL vial (hydrochloride); 2 mg per mL in 25 mL vial (hydrochloride) \n\nIndication\n\n(1) Unspecified malignant neoplasms of ill-defined or unspecified sites; (2) Rhabdomyosarcoma primary site; (3) Malignant neoplasms of breast; (4) Hodgkin lymphoma; (5) Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas; (6) Plasma cell myeloma; (7) Follicular lymphoma; (8) Burkitt lymphoma including Burkitt leukaemia; (9) Malignant neoplasms of kidney, except renal pelvis; (10) Osteosarcoma of bone and articular cartilage of unspecified sites; (11) Lymphoid leukaemia, not elsewhere classified; (12) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative; (13) Other specified malignant neoplasms of breast; (14) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-positive; (15) Ewing sarcoma of bone and articular cartilage of unspecified sites; (16) Kaposi sarcoma of unspecified primary site \n\nWHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines\n\n### 7.4 FDA National Drug Code Directory[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=FDA-National-Drug-Code-Directory&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nNational Drug Code (NDC) Directory\n\n### 7.5 Drug Labels[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Drug-Labels&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nDrug and label\n\nDailyMed\n\n### 7.6 Cancer Drugs[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Cancer-Drugs&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\n1 of 2 items\n\nDrug Name\n\nAdriamycin ([Doxorubicin Hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin%20Hydrochloride))\n\nFDA Approved\n\nYes \n\nDrug Use\n\n[Doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat:\n\n• acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n\n• acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\n\n• breast cancer.

It is generally thought to exert its antitumor effect by destabilizing DNA structures through intercalation, thus introducing DNA strand breakages and damages. Not only does it alter the transcriptomes of the cells, failure in repairing DNA structures can also initiate the apoptotic pathways. Additionally, doxorubicin intercalation can also interfere with vital enzyme activity, such as topoisomerase II, DNA polymerase, and RNA polymerase, leading to cell cycle arrests.

Sexual differences in doxorubicin were also observed, with men having a higher clearance compared to women (1088 mL/min/m 2 versus 433 mL/min/m 2). Following the administration of doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m 2 of [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride), the plasma clearance was estimated to be 1540 mL/min/m 2 in children greater than 2 years of age and 813 mL/min/m 2 in infants younger than 2 years of age.\n\nDrugBank\n\nNonencapsulated [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) is not stable in gastric acid, and animal studies indicate that the drug undergoes little, if any, absorption from the GI tract.

The pharmacokinetics of liposomally encapsulated doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/sq m have been reported to be nonlinear. At a dose of 50 mg/sq m, a longer elimination half-life and lower clearance compared to those observed with a 20 mg/sq m dose are expected, with greater-than-proportional increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Encapsulation of [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) in PEG-stabilized (Stealth) liposomes substantially alters the pharmacokinetics of the drug relative to conventional iv formulations (ie, nonencapsulated drug), with resultant decreased distribution into the peripheral compartment, increased distribution into Kaposi's lesions, and decreased plasma clearance.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009.

Following iv administration of a single 20-mg/sq m dose of liposomal [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride), doxorubicin concentrations in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions were 19 (range: 3-53)-fold higher than those observed in healthy skin; however, blood concentrations in the lesions or in healthy skin were not considered. In addition, distribution of doxorubicin into Kaposi's sarcoma lesions following iv administration of liposomally encapsulated drug was 5.2-11.4 times greater than that following iv administration of comparable doses of a conventional (nonencapsulated) injection. The mechanism by which liposomal encapsulation enhances doxorubicin distribution into Kaposi's sarcoma lesions has not been elucidated fully, but similar PEG-stabilized liposomes containing colloidal [gold](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Gold) as a marker have been shown to enter Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions in animals. Extravasation of the liposomes also may occur by passage of the particles through endothelial cell gaps present in Kaposi's sarcoma.

However, approximately half of the dose is eliminated from the body unchanged. The two-electron reduction is the major metabolic pathway of doxorubicin. In this pathway, doxorubicin is reduced to [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol), a secondary alcohol, by various enzymes, including Alcohol dehydrogenase [[NADP](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADP)(+)], Carbonyl reductase [[NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)] 1, Carbonyl reductase [[NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)] 3, and Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3. The one-electron reduction is facilitated by several oxidoreductase, both cytosolic and mitochondrial, to form a doxirubicin-semiquinone radical. These enzymes include mitochondrial and cystolic [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH) dehydrogenates, [xanthine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/xanthine) oxidase, and [nitric oxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nitric%20oxide) synthases. This semiquinone metabolite can be re-oxidized to doxorubicin, although with the concurrent formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and [hydrogen peroxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrogen%20peroxide). It is the ROS generating through this pathway that contributes most to the doxorubicin-related adverse effects, particularly cardiotoxicity, rather than through doxorubicin semiquinone formation. Deglycosidation is a minor metabolic pathway, since it only accounts for 1 to 2% of doxorubicin metabolism. Under the catalysis of cytoplasmic [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH) quinone dehydrogenase, [xanthine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/xanthine) oxidase, [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)-cytochrome P450 reductase, doxorubicin can either be reduced to doxorubicin deoxyaglycone or hydrolyzed to doxorubicin hydroxyaglycone.\n\nDrugBank\n\nNonencapsulated doxorubicin is metabolized by [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)-dependent aldoketoreductases to the hydrophilic 13-hydroxyl metabolite [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol), which exhibits antineoplastic activity and is the major metabolite; these reductases are present in most if not all cells, but particularly in erythrocytes, liver, and kidney. Although not clearly established, [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol) also appears to be the moiety responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of the drug. Undetectable or low plasma concentrations (ie, 0.8-26.2 ng/mL) of [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol) have been reported following iv administration of a single 10- to 50-mg/sq m dose of [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) as a PEG-stabilized liposomal injection; it remains to be established whether such liposomally encapsulated anthracyclines are less cardiotoxic than conventional (nonencapsulated) drug, and the usual precautions for unencapsulated drug currently also should be observed for the liposomal preparation. Substantially reduced or absent plasma concentrations of the usual major metabolite of doxorubicin observed with the PEG-stabilized liposomal injection suggests that either the drug is not released appreciably from the liposomes as they circulate or that some doxorubicin may be released but that the rate of [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol) elimination greatly exceeds the release rate; [doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) encapsulated in liposomes that have not been PEG-stabilized is metabolized to [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol).\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009.

The aglycones are formed in microsomes by [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)-dependent, cytochrome reductase-mediated cleavage of the amino sugar moiety. The enzymatic reduction of doxorubicin to 7-deoxyaglycones is important to the cytotoxic effect of the drug since it results in [hydroxyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyl) radicals that cause extensive cell damage and death. With nonencapsulated doxorubicin, more than 20% of the total drug in plasma is present as metabolites as soon as 5 minutes after a dose, 70% in 30 minutes, 75% in 4 hours, and 90% in 24 hours.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009.

The distribution half-life of doxorubicin is approximately 5 minutes. For the liposomal formulation, the first-phase and second-phase half-lives were calculated to be 4.7 ± 1.1 and 52.3 ± 5.6 hours respectively for a 10 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin in patients with AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma.\n\nDrugBank\n\nPlasma concentrations of nonencapsulated doxorubicin and its metabolites decline in a biphasic or triphasic manner. In the first phase of the triphasic model, nonencapsulated doxorubicin is rapidly metabolized, presumably by a first-pass effect through the liver. It appears that most of this metabolism is completed before the entire dose is administered. In the triphasic model, nonencapsulated doxorubicin and its metabolites are rapidly distributed into the extravascular compartment with a plasma half-life of approximately 0.2-0.6 hours for doxorubicin and 3.3 hours for its metabolites. This is followed by relatively prolonged plasma concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites, probably resulting from tissue binding. During the second phase, the plasma half-life of nonencapsulated doxorubicin is 16.7 hours and that of its metabolites is 31.7 hours. In the biphasic model, the initial distribution t1/2 has been reported to average about 5-10 minutes, and the terminal elimination t1/2 has been reported to average about 30 hours.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009.

Doxorubicin can intercalate into DNA through the [anthraquinone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/anthraquinone) ring, which stabilizes the complex by forming [hydrogen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Hydrogen) bonds with DNA bases. Intercalation of doxorubicin can introduce torsional stress into the polynucleotide structure, thus destabilizing nucleosome structures and leading to nucleosome eviction and replacement. Additionally, the doxorubicin-DNA complex can interfere with topoisomerase II enzyme activity by preventing relegation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA breaks, thus inhibiting replication and transcription and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, doxorubicin can be metabolized by microsomal [NADPH](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/NADPH)-cytochrome P-450 reductase into a semiquinone radical, which can be reoxidized in the presence of [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) to form [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) radicals. Reactive oxygen species have been known to cause cellular damage through various mechanisms, including lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Although free radicals generated from this pathway can be deactivated by catalase and superoxide dismutase, tumor and myocardial cells tend to lack these enzymes, thus explaining doxorubicin's effectiveness against cancer cells and tendency to cause cardiotoxicity.\n\nDrugBank\n\n[Doxorubicin hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin%20hydrochloride) is an antineoplastic antibiotic with pharmacologic actions similar to those of [daunorubicin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/daunorubicin). Although the drug has anti-infective properties, its cytotoxicity precludes its use as an anti-infective agent. The precise and/or principal mechanism(s) of the antineoplastic action of doxorubicin is not fully understood. It appears that the cytotoxic effect of the drug results from a complex system of multiple modes of action related to free radical formation secondary to metabolic activation of the doxorubicin by electron reduction, intercalation of the drug into DNA, induction of DNA breaks and chromosomal aberrations, and alterations in cell membranes induced by the drug. Evidence from in vitro studies in cells treated with doxorubicin suggests that apoptosis (programmed cell death) also may be involved in the drug's mechanism of action. These and other mechanisms (chelation of metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes) also may contribute to the cardiotoxic effects of the drug.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009. Bethesda, MD. (2009)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nDoxorubicin undergoes enzymatic 1- and 2-electron reduction to the corresponding semiquinone and [dihydroquinone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dihydroquinone). 7-Deoxyaglycones are formed enzymatically by 1-electron reduction, and the resulting semiquinone free radical reacts with [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) to produce the [hydroxyl](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyl) radical in a cascade of reactions; this radical may lead to cell death by reacting with DNA, RNA, cell membranes, and proteins. The [dihydroquinone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dihydroquinone) that results from 2-electron reduction of doxorubicin also can be formed by the reaction of 2 semiquinones. In the presence of [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen), [dihydroquinone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dihydroquinone) reacts to form [hydrogen peroxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydrogen%20peroxide), and in its absence, loses its sugar and gives rise to the quinone methide, a monofunctional alkylating agent with low affinity for DNA. The contribution of [dihydroquinone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dihydroquinone) and the quinone methide to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is unclear. Experimental evidence indicates that doxorubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, causing inhibition of DNA synthesis and DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by the resulting template disordering and steric obstruction. Doxorubicin also inhibits protein synthesis. Doxorubicin is active throughout the cell cycle including the interphase.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009. Bethesda, MD. (2009)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\nSeveral anthracycline-induced effects may contribute to the development of cardiotoxicity. In animals, anthracyclines cause a selective inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression for ?-actin, troponin, myosin light-chain 2, and the M isoform of [creatine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/creatine) kinase, which may result in myofibrillar loss associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Other potential causes of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include myocyte damage from [calcium](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Calcium) overload, altered myocardial adrenergic function, release of vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Limited data indicate that [calcium](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Calcium)-channel blocking agents (eg, [prenylamine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/prenylamine)) or beta-adrenergic blocking agents may prevent [calcium](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Calcium) overload ... It has been suggested that the principal cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free radical damage to DNA.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009. Bethesda, MD.

Chelation of metal ions, particularly [iron](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Iron), by the drug results in a doxorubicin-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) free radicals, and the complex is a powerful oxidant that can initiate lipid peroxidation in the absence of [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) free radicals. This reaction is not blocked by free-radical scavengers, and probably is the principal mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009.

Superoxide prodn in heart sarcosomes and the mitochondrial fraction was incr. Apparently, free radical formation by doxorubicin, which occurs in the same myocardial compartments that are subject to drug-induced tissue injury, may damage the heart by exceeding the [oxygen](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Oxygen) radical detoxifying capacity of cardiac mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\n[PMID:6293697](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6293697)\n\nDoroshow JH; Cancer Res 43 (2): 460 (1983)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\n### 8.10 Human Metabolite Information[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Human-Metabolite-Information&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\n#### 8.10.1 Cellular Locations[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Cellular-Locations&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\n*   Cytoplasm \n*   Membrane \n\nHuman Metabolome Database (HMDB)\n\n#### 8.10.2 Metabolite Pathways[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Metabolite-Pathways&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\n[Doxorubicin Metabolism Pathway](http://smpdb.ca/view/SMP00650)\n\nHuman Metabolome Database (HMDB)\n\n### 8.11 Biochemical Reactions[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Biochemical-Reactions&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nPubChem\n\n### 8.12 Transformations[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Transformations&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nChEMBL\n\nNORMAN Suspect List Exchange\n\n9 Use and Manufacturing[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Use-and-Manufacturing&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 9.1 Uses[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Uses&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nTherapeutic Category: Antineoplastic \n\nO'Neil, M.J.

It might be possible to breastfeed safely during intermittent therapy with an appropriate period of breastfeeding abstinence; however, the high levels and persistence of the active metabolite [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol) in milk make defining an appropriate abstinence interval difficult. Some have suggested a breastfeeding abstinence period of 5 to 10 days after a dose. More recent pharmacokinetic modeling using a worst-case scenario suggests that 13 days would be required to minimize both systemic and gut toxicity after the colostral phase.\n\nChemotherapy may adversely affect the normal microbiome and chemical makeup of breastmilk. Women who receive chemotherapy during pregnancy are more likely to have difficulty nursing their infant.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\nA woman was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma at 27 weeks of pregnancy. Labor was induced at 34 4/7 weeks and treatment was begun with a standard regimen of rituximab, [cyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cyclophosphamide), doxorubicin, [vincristine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vincristine), and [prednisone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/prednisone) in unspecified doses on a 21-day cycle, starting on day 2 postpartum. She pumped and discarded her milk and fed her infant donor milk for the first 10 days of each cycle and then breastfed her infant for the remaining 10 days before the next treatment cycle. The 10-day period of breastfeeding abstinence was determined by using about 3 half-lives of [vincristine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vincristine). After completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy, her infant was reportedly healthy and developing without any complications.\n\n◉ Effects on Lactation and Breastmilk\n\nA study of adolescent males who had received chemotherapy for childhood malignancies found that having received doxorubicin was associated with elevated serum prolactin concentrations.\n\nA woman diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma during the second trimester of pregnancy received 3 rounds of chemotherapy during the third trimester of pregnancy and resumed chemotherapy 4 weeks postpartum. Milk samples were collected 15 to 30 minutes before and after chemotherapy for 16 weeks after restarting. The regimen consisted of doxorubicin 40 mg, [bleomycin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/bleomycin) 16 units, [vinblastine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/vinblastine) 9.6 mg and [dacarbazine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dacarbazine) 600 mg, all given over a 2-hour period every 2 weeks. The microbial population and metabolic profile of her milk were compared to those of 8 healthy women who were not receiving chemotherapy. The breastmilk microbial population in the patient was markedly different from that of the healthy women, with increases in Acinetobacter sp., Xanthomonadacae and Stenotrophomonas sp. and decreases in Bifidobacterium sp. and Eubacterium sp. Marked differences were also found among numerous chemical components in the breastmilk of the treated woman, most notably DHA and [inositol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/inositol) were decreased.\n\nA telephone follow-up study was conducted on 74 women who received cancer chemotherapy at one center during the second or third trimester of pregnancy to determine if they were successful at breastfeeding postpartum. Only 34% of the women were able to exclusively breastfeed their infants, and 66% of the women reported experiencing breastfeeding difficulties. This was in comparison to a 91% breastfeeding success rate in 22 other mothers diagnosed during pregnancy, but not treated with chemotherapy. Other statistically significant correlations included: 1. mothers with breastfeeding difficulties had an average of 5.5 cycles of chemotherapy compared with 3.8 cycles among mothers who had no difficulties; and 2. mothers with breastfeeding difficulties received their first cycle of chemotherapy on average 3.4 weeks earlier in pregnancy. Of the 62 women who received a doxorubicin-containing regimen, 39 had breastfeeding difficulties.\n\nDrugs and Lactation Database (LactMed)\n\n#### 12.1.7 Exposure Routes[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Exposure-Routes&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nParenteral (intravenous) \n\nToxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB)\n\n#### 12.1.8 Signs and Symptoms[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Signs-and-Symptoms&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nThe most common side effects from antibiotics are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. Fungal infections of the mouth, digestive tract and vagina can also occur with antibiotics \n\nToxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB)\n\n#### 12.1.9 Adverse Effects[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Adverse-Effects&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nAdverse reactions are common after doxorubicin administration, including fatigue, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and oral sores. Bone marrow suppression and an increased risk of secondary malignancy diagnoses may occur. Doxorubicin extravasation during intravenous administration can result in severe tissue ulceration and necrosis, which worsens over time. Doxorubicin is also associated with significant cardiac toxicity, which limits the long-term use of the drug. The mechanism of action of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity differs from the drug’s antitumor mechanism. It involves increased oxidative stress, down-regulation of cardiac-specific genes, and induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis by doxorubicin. The acute cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin occurs within days of the drug’s administration and occurs in approximately 11% of patients who receive the drug.\n\nAcute cardiac toxicity manifests as reversible myopericarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, or arrhythmias. Doxorubicin-related arrhythmias occur in up to 26% of patients who receive the therapy and can include sinus tachycardia, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia. Rarely, acute left ventricular dysfunction can occur after doxorubicin administration; this condition is reversible. Chronic, late cardiac toxicity may also occur after doxorubicin administration and is the most serious and potentially lethal adverse effect associated with doxorubicin therapy. The incidence of chronic doxorubicin cardiac toxicity is approximately 1.7%.\n\nDoxorubicin-induced irreversible cardiomyopathy occurs within a few months of the end of treatment but has also been reported to occur up to twenty years after treatment termination. Congestive heart failure may also occur. Risk factors for doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure include a higher cumulative drug dose, extremes of age, combination chemotherapy with other cardiotoxic drugs, pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and previous radiation to the mediastinal region. When congestive heart failure develops after doxorubicin administration, the 1-year mortality rate is approximately 50%.\n\nStatPearls\n\n#### 12.1.10 Acute Effects[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Acute-Effects&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nChemIDplus\n\n#### 12.1.11 Toxicity Data[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nLD50: 21 800 ug/kg (Subcutaneous, Rat) (A308) \n\nToxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB)\n\n#### 12.1.12 Treatment[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Treatment&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nTreatment of acute overdosage consists of treatment of the severely myelosuppressed patient with hospitalization, antibiotics, platelet and granulocyte transfusions, and symptomatic treatment of mucositis.

In this paper, we have focused on five cytostatic compounds used in high amounts ([cyclophosphamide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cyclophosphamide), [cisplatin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cisplatin), [5-fluorouracil](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-fluorouracil), doxorubicin, and [etoposide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/etoposide)), and we have investigated their ecotoxicity in bacterial Pseudomonas putida growth-inhibition test, algal Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth-inhibition test, and Daphnia magna acute immobilization test. Genotoxicity also was assessed with Escherichia coli SOS-chromotest (with and without metabolic activation) and the GreenScreen Assay using yeast S. cerevisiae. All tested compounds showed significant effects in most of the assays with lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing 50% effects (EC50s) values ranging within ug/L to mg/L. The most toxic compound was [5-fluorouracil](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-fluorouracil) in the assays with P. putida (EC50 = 0.027 mg/L) and P. subcapitata (EC50 = 0.11 mg/L), although [cisplatin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cisplatin) and doxorubicin were the most toxic to D. magna (EC50 = 0.64 and 2.0 mg/L, respectively). These two chemicals were also the most genotoxic in the SOS-chromotest (minimum genotoxic concentrations [MGC] = 0.07-0.2 mg/L), and [5-fluorouracil](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-fluorouracil) was the most genotoxic in the eukaryotic yeast assay (MGC = 0.02 mg/L). Our investigation seems to indicate generally lower risks of acute effects at concentrations expected in the environment. However, some effective concentrations were relatively low and chronic toxicity of cytostatics (and/or their transformation products), as well as specific sources of human pharmaceuticals such as hospital effluents, require research attention.\n\n[PMID:17867890](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17867890)\n\nZounkova R et al; Environ Toxicol Chem 26 (10): 2208-14 (2007)\n\nHazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\n\n#### 12.2.3 Environmental Fate / Exposure Summary[](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicin#section=Environmental-Fate-Exposure-Summary&fullscreen=true \"Open this section in a new browser window\")\n\nDoxorubicin's production and use as an antineoplastic may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Doxorubicin is isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius following chemical mutation. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-23 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates doxorubicin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase doxorubicin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Doxorubicin absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, doxorubicin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6,000. Estimated values for pKa1, pKa2, and pKa3 of 7.34, 8.46, and 9.46, respectively, indicate that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic [carbon](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Carbon) and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the amine exists as an cation and cations do not volatilize. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water), doxorubicin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa values indicate that doxorubicin will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from [water](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water) or moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 0.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to doxorubicin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where doxorubicin is produced or used. Exposure to doxorubicin among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug adriamycin, an antineoplastic.

[Cisplatin](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cisplatin) was undetectable in human milk. Milk concentrations of DOX often exceeded those detected in concomitant plasma samples. For DOX, the highest milk:plasma concentration ratio was 4.43:1 and was observed 24 hours after administration of the drug. The area under concentration versus time curve (AUC) for DOX was approximately the same in plasma and milk. [Doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Doxorubicinol) was the major metabolite of DOX in plasma and in milk. The AUC for [doxorubicinol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/doxorubicinol) was ten times higher in milk than in plasma.

Historical findings of patients with cancer date back to ancient Egyptian and Greek civilizations, where this disease was predominantly treated with radical surgery and cautery that were often ineffective, leading to the death of patients. Over the centuries, important discoveries allowed to identify the biological and pathological features of tumors, without however contributing to the development of effective therapeutic approaches until the end of the 1800s, when the discovery of X-rays and their use for the treatment of tumors provided the first modern therapeutic approach in medical oncology. However, a real breakthrough took place after the Second World War, with the discovery of cytotoxic antitumor drugs and the birth of chemotherapy for the treatment of various hematological and solid tumors. Starting from this epochal turning point, there has been an exponential growth of studies concerning the use of new drugs for cancer treatment. The second fundamental breakthrough in the field of oncology and pharmacology took place at the beginning of the ‘80s, thanks to molecular and cellular biology studies that allowed the development of specific drugs for some molecular targets involved in neoplastic processes, giving rise to targeted therapy. Both chemotherapy and target therapy have significantly improved the survival and quality of life of cancer patients inducing sometimes complete tumor remission. Subsequently, at the turn of the third millennium, thanks to genetic engineering studies, there was a further advancement of clinical oncology and pharmacology with the introduction of monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced or metastatic tumors, for which no effective treatment was available before. Today, cancer research is always aimed at the study and development of new therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. Currently, several researchers are focused on the development of cell therapies, anti-tumor vaccines, and new biotechnological drugs that have already shown promising results in preclinical studies, therefore, in the near future, we will certainly assist to a new revolution in the field of medical oncology.\n\n**Keywords:** cancer, antineoplastic drugs, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, cell therapy\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Epidemiology of cancer\n\nCancer is often referred to as the “Pathology of the Century” assuming the connotations of an endemic disease spread throughout the world. It has also been defined as the “the modern disease par excellence” (Roy Porter) or even the “the quintessential product of modernity” (Siddhartha Mukherjee) (Bynum and Porter, [2005](#B39); Mukherjee, [2011](#B187); Arnold-Forster, [2016](#B12)). These two definitions are universally recognized and are justified by the drastic increase in incidence and mortality, witnessed since the end of the eighteenth century until today, where cancer represents the second leading cause of death worldwide (Ferlay et al., [2015](#B81)). In particular, in 2015, over 8.7 million cancer deaths were recorded worldwide and about 17.5 million new cases of neoplasia were diagnosed (GBD Mortality Causes of Death Collaborators, [2016](#B93)). Moreover, despite advances in the diagnostic, medical and interventional fields, the number of new cases of cancer has increased by about 33% in the decade 2005–2015, mainly due to the increase in population and the increase in the average age of life. Conversely, mortality rates are almost unchanged, although many Countries experienced a decrease in cancer mortality notwithstanding increasing incidence rates (Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration et al., [2018](#B100)).\n\nSupporting these recent epidemiological data, the examination of a longer period of time and the analysis of the data collected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) over the last 40 years showed that there has been a continuous and almost stable increase in incidence rates of all cancers. While a general decrease in mortality rates was recorded above all in the last 20 years, although from the period between 1975 and 1995 there was a slight increase in mortality rates (Figure [1](#F1)). The reduction in mortality rates can be easily associated with the continuous progress in the medical and pharmacological fields that has allowed to reduce the cancer deaths, thanks to the recent introduction in therapy of more effective drugs and therapeutic approaches (Soneji et al., [2014](#B241); Miller et al., [2016](#B175)).\n\n#### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/e989941f7c42/fphar-09-01300-g0001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=6243123_fphar-09-01300-g0001.jpg)\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/e989941f7c42/fphar-09-01300-g0001.jpg)\n\nCancer incidence and mortality from 1975 to 2015. **(A)** In the last 40 years, from 1975 to 2015, there has been a general increase in incidence rates for several cancers as a consequence of the demographic increase. Thanks to cancer prevention and screening strategies the number of many types of cancer has decreased. In particular, for cervix uteri and stomach cancers, a decrease in incidence rates was observed, while the incidence rates for esophagus, bladder, lung and colon remained unchanged. Finally, an increase in incidence rates was recorded for hepatic carcinoma, for breast cancer, NHL and above all for melanoma, whose incidence has increased radically in recent years; **(B)** Cancer mortality rates have globally decreased thanks to the development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In particular, in the last 40 years there has been a decrease in mortality rates for prostate, breast, colon, bladder, and especially for cervix uteri and stomach cancers. Almost unaltered mortality rates are observed for melanoma, pancreatic and esophageal cancers for which really effective pharmacological treatments are not yet available. An increase in mortality was observed for hepatic carcinoma while lung cancer and NHL showed a variable trend over the years with a slight increase in mortality rates from 1975 to 1995, and a general decrease in mortality rates recorded above all in the last 20 years.\n\nWhen epidemiological data concerning the so-called “big killers” (i.e., cancer of lung, breast, colon, prostate, stomach, liver, cervix uteri, esophagus, bladder, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), pancreas, melanoma) are examined, it is instead observed how the trend of incidence and mortality rates are very variable according to the type of pathology taken into account. In particular, some tumor types, such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, have still maintained mortality rates almost unchanged compared to 40 years ago (Figure [1](#F1)).\n\nThese epidemiological data show that, even nowadays, cancer represents a global health problem and one of the greatest challenges in the medical field, despite the important pharmacological and therapeutic discoveries we have seen since the second post-war period up to the present day (Gittelman, [2016](#B99)).\n\n### Cancer treatment before the 1900s\n\nAs previously mentioned, cancer is considered a modern disease, but the oncology has their roots in much older times, as evidenced by antique documents dating back to ancient Egyptian and Greek civilizations (Sudhakar, [2009](#B248)).\n\nSeveral historical and scientific records show that cancer was present even before the appearance of human on earth. In fact, in some fossil remains of dinosaurs or prehistoric animals traces of bone tumors have been found, probably osteosarcomas or bone metastases (Rothschild et al., [2003](#B225); Dumbravbrevea et al., [2016](#B68)). The first historical and scientific records of tumors in humans date back to the Egyptian period, around 3000 B.C., and refer to the writings contained in a papyrus found by Edwin Smith, in which a case of breast cancer and the surgical treatment adopted were described (Breasted, [1930](#B29); Sanchez and Meltzer, [2012](#B230)).\n\nOther writings date back to 1500 B.C.; in particular, the Ebers' papyrus, contains information on different types of cancer (skin cancer, uterine cancer, stomach cancer and rectum), where the neoplastic pathology is recognized as incurable. In this papyrus, cancer is not considered as due to physical or biological causes, but, rather, as the results of esoteric forces, linked to the negative will of the ancient Egyptian Gods (Ebers, [1875](#B70); Bryan and Smith, [1930](#B34); Kelly and Mahalingam, [2015](#B143)).\n\nIt was only in 400 B.C. that cancer was recognized as a disease with specific biological causes rather than related to supernatural events. In particular, the first “scientist” describing cancer in a scientific way was Hippocrates, who considered the tumor as a disease caused by the imbalance between the 4 main body humors, i.e., blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile. Furthermore, Hippocrates enunciated the first scientific theory on the origins of cancer, hypothesizing that it originated when there was an excess of black bile in the body, and divided the tumors into three different categories: hard cancers, ulcerated cancers, and hidden cancers, defining the latter incurable (Karpozilos and Pavlidis, [2004](#B140); Tsoucalas and Sgantzos, [2016](#B252)).\n\nThe theory of body humors remained predominant for a long time and was further refined by Galen, a physician who lived in Rome around the 130–200 A.C. Galen improved the Hippocratic theory by defining tumors as curable pathologies when caused by the alterations of yellow bile, and incurable when caused by the alterations of the black bile, particularly when this last humor infiltrates the tissues. Furthermore, Galen indicated the first surgical strategies for the treatment of tumors (Galen, [1565](#B92); Papavramidou et al., [2010](#B202); Hajdu, [2016](#B115)).\n\nFrom the Ancient Greek and Greco-Roman Age up to the Modern Era the theories of Hippocrates and Galen remained the most credited. Moreover, from the Egyptian period until the end of the nineteenth century the treatment of cancers was mostly based on the adoption of a healthy diet, cautery and radical surgical approaches for superficial tumor forms, while for the incurable deep forms, mostly used palliative pain therapies, based on poppy (*Papaver somniferum*) extract (Faguet, [2015](#B75)). The use of these antiquated therapeutic practices often hesitated in the death of the patient, due to the progression of the very same tumor and/or to sequelae of infectious nature related to the surgical intervention and the poor hygienic conditions.\n\nWe may consider modern oncology as born in the 1700s, when scientists began to study, for the first time, the carcinogenic effects of some substances, such as tobacco or soot. However, a number of previous important discoveries and inventions paved the way for the birth of modern oncology. From the sixteenth century to the late nineteenth century, there has been a revolution in the medical, surgical and interventional field thanks to the important discoveries of many scientists who studied tumors from an anatomical, biological, epidemiological and therapeutic point of view. This revolution began with the discoveries of Paracelsus (1493–1541) to reach the intuitions of Percival Pott (1714–1788), passing from the invention of the microscope and the theories of cancer onset postulated by Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), to the first approaches of experimental oncology and radiotherapy promoted by the first medical oncologists and by Marie and Pierre Curie, respectively (Faguet, [2015](#B75); see Table [1](#T1) for the milestones of oncology before 1900).\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nMilestones of oncology research before 1900.\n\n|  | **Historical period** | **Major discoveries in oncology** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ancient discoveries and theories of cancer | 3000 B.C. | In Edwin Smith's papyrus the first case of human cancer is described |\n|  | 1500 B.C. | Ebers' papyrus describes the tumors of the skin, uterus, stomach and rectum |\n|  | 400 B.C. | Hippocrates proposes the first theory on the development of tumors |\n|  | 130–200 | Galen deepens the theory of Hippocrates, proposing that the excess of black bile causes incurable tumors while the excess of yellow bile causes treatable tumors |\n|  | 300–400 | Oribasius of Baghdad confirms that the tumors are caused by an excess of black bile |\n| No significant progress in the study of tumors[\\*](#TN1),[\\*\\*](#TN2) | 527–565 | Aëtius of Amida introduces the treatment of breast tumors by amputation of the entire organ |\n|  | 625–690 | Paul of Aegina describes the tumors of the uterus and the surgical approach for the treatment of the bladder, the thyroid and the polypectomy of the nasal polyps |\n|  | 860–932 | Rhazes di Baghdad describes new treatments for tumors in the “De Chirurgia” manuscript. |\n|  | 980–1037 | Avicenna introduces the removal of tumors of the rectum |\n|  | 1070–1162 | Averroes of Cordoba describes the tumors of the esophagus and rectum and introduces the hysterectomy for the removal of uterine tumors |\n|  | 1500 | Paracelsus questions Hippocrates and Galen theories and hypothesizes that tumors develop due to an accumulation of “salts” in the blood |\n|  | 1543 | Andreas Vesalius published the manuscript “De Humani corporis fabrica” containing anatomical information resulting from post-mortem examinations |\n|  | 1600 | Doctors and surgeons propose that the coagulation and fermentation of blood and/or lymph are the cause of the development of tumors |\n|  | 1600–1620 | Invention of the microscope |\n|  | 1700 | Boerhaave hypothesizes that cancer is most likely induced by elements, present in water or in the ground, which defines viruses.

In the following years, Marie and Pierre Curie identified a substance with radiations two million times higher than Uranium (studied by Becquerel), that they called Radium (1898) (Kułakowski, [2011](#B154)). The two scientists initially studied the use of X-rays for diagnostic purposes but eventually realized that they were harmful at the cellular level, thus suggesting their use in the treatment of tumors (Curie and Curie, [1899](#B55)). X-rays were already used in 1896 by Emil H. Grubbé for the treatment of breast cancer (Grubbé, [1933](#B106); Nakayama and Bonasso, [2016](#B191)), while Anton Ultimus Sjögren applied this treatment to an epithelioma of the mouth in 1899 (Nakayama and Bonasso, [2016](#B191)). However, modern radiotherapy only began in 1920, when Claudius Regaud demonstrated that radiation fractionation could be used to treat several human cancers, by reducing the side effects of the treatment itself (Deloch et al., [2016](#B61); Moulder and Seymour, [2017](#B183)).\n\nDespite these achievements, medical and interventional approaches to tumors before the Second World War were essentially radical methods, aimed at the complete eradication of the disease before it can spread and metastasize throughout the organism. Therefore, surgical treatment, often representing the only therapeutic option despite its demolition impact, resulted ineffective in patients with advanced tumor pathology or whenever the surgical act failed to remove all the tumor mass (Hajdu, [2011](#B114); Hajdu and Vadmal, [2013](#B117)). An epochal turning point for the treatment of tumors was reached in the mid-1900s, with the birth of chemotherapy and the subsequent evolution of modern medical therapy of tumors. The discovery and synthesis of new compounds represented the basis to develop effective therapeutic interventions in patients with different types of advanced solid tumors or hematological drug treatments, alone or in association with surgical and radio treatments (Arruebo et al., [2011](#B13); Figure [2](#F2)).\n\n#### Figure 2.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/d0608a289da0/fphar-09-01300-g0002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=6243123_fphar-09-01300-g0002.jpg)\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/d0608a289da0/fphar-09-01300-g0002.jpg)\n\nTimeline of epochal turning points in modern oncology. After the development of radiotherapy in the early 1900, the modern oncology began with the discovery of the first chemotherapeutic drugs around 1940. Subsequently a breakthrough in the field of medical oncology occurred with the development of targeted therapy in 1980, which determined an improvement in the effectiveness of cancer treatments. The last epochal turn took place in 2010 with the introduction of immune checkpoints inhibitors for the treatment of advanced and metastatic tumors.\n\nThe first revolutionary pharmacological approach was represented by the use of chemotherapeutic antitumor drugs, which cytotoxic against various tumors; however, the toxicity to normal tissues and the development of drug resistance mechanisms by tumor cells represented important obstacles to overcome (Chabner and Roberts, [2005](#B45)).\n\nSubsequently, with the definition of the DNA structure and the development of new molecular techniques for DNA analysis, specific gene alterations responsible for neoplastic transformation were identified. These alterations were studied in order to synthesize drugs specifically targeting them, i.e., the targeted therapies, specific for certain tumors (Krause and Van Etten, [2005](#B152)).\n\nFurthermore, in the last 20 years new anti-tumor therapeutic strategies, which make use of new biotechnological drugs, have been developed. These strategies have significantly increased the effectiveness of treatments and the survival rates of cancer patients. Among these, monoclonal antibodies and new immunotherapeutic drugs have allowed the development of new personalized therapeutic protocols (personalized medicine) that have shown very high efficacy and low toxicity for patients (Scott et al., [2012](#B233); Tsimberidou, [2015](#B251)). In addition, the research in the field of oncology is constantly aimed at the discovery of new and effective therapeutic strategies, including the promising CAR-T Cell therapy and gene therapy (Yescarta and Kymriah) (Gross et al., [1989](#B105); Rosenberg et al., [1990](#B220); Vile et al., [2000](#B258); Rosenbaum, [2017](#B218); Hidai and Kitano, [2018](#B124)). Moreover, new therapeutic combined protocols, which use different drugs and different types of treatment, are undergoing clinical trials, in order to find therapeutic schemes that can increase the treatment efficacy and reduce the possibility of developing pharmacological resistance (Hu et al., [2010](#B127); Vanneman and Dranoff, [2012](#B256)).\n\nFinally, nowadays, the development of a new drug must necessarily include the integration of multidisciplinary skills to obtain new pharmaceutical molecules available for the market, with good safety and tolerability. In particular, the development of a new drug can no longer be exempt from an initial bioinformatics *in silico* to simulate the level of interaction of hundreds of new molecules with a specific receptor target of the new drug to be implemented. Following the bioinformatics study, it is essential to use several *in vitro* and preclinical animal models to establish the toxicity of the new drug and its therapeutic potential. Therefore, today, bioinformatics and preclinical studies are the fundamental steps to develop a new effective drug endowed with the highest potential efficacy. The *in silico* and preclinical screening of thousands of different pharmacological molecules has in fact allowed the researchers to obtain new oncological drugs which are currently used in clinical practice while significantly reducing mortality from oncological diseases.\n\n## The birth and evolution of chemotherapy for the treatment of tumors\n\nAfter the discovery and application of X-rays for the diagnosis and treatment of some tumors, there has been a period of standoff for the research of new treatments to be used in cancer care. A new and significant turn to the treatment of tumors took place around the ‘40s of the twentieth century, during the Second World War, with the accidental discovery of the first DNA alkylating agent, a nitrogen mustard derived from iprite, used for war purposes, whose toxic effects determined bone marrow toxicity and killing of white blood cells. In particular, in December 1943, the John Harvey ship carrying nitrogen mustard bombs was bombed and the toxic gas released into the atmosphere; in the following months, almost a thousand men and women previously exposed to the gas died due to complications characterized by bone marrow aplasia (Brookes, [1990](#B30)).\n\n### Alkylating agents\n\nThe bone marrow toxicity of the nitrogen mustard is due to its alkylating activity toward DNA, occurring through two molecular steps; first the aziridinium group of the nitrogen mustard binds the guanine bases, then interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are formed after the displacement of a chlorine (Brookes and Lawley, [1960](#B31), [1961](#B32)). The formation of ICLs is at the basis of the cytotoxic activity of nitrogen mustards, preventing DNA duplication and leading to cell death, particularly in the presence of high cell turnover. Later on, in 1946, Alfred Gilman and Louis Goodman at Yale University discovered the pharmacological effect of nitrogen mustards on organisms affected by certain tumors, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and other lymphomas and leukemia (Gilman, [1946](#B97), [1963](#B98)). Between 1946 and 1948, the first results of the clinical studies on the therapeutic efficacy of nitrogen mustards were published, formally defining the first chemotherapeutic drugs used in modern oncology (Goodman and Wintrobe, [1946](#B102); Rhoads, [1946](#B213); Faloon and Gorham, [1948](#B77)).\n\nThe first nitrogen mustard to be used as an alkylating agent in clinical practice was Mechlorethamine, able to bind nitrogen N7 of guanine and to inhibit DNA replication by the above-described mechanisms. In particular, the first uses of Mechlorethamine were intended for patients with prostate cancer and in patients with lymphoid malignancies, such as Hodgkin's disease, lympho-reticulosarcomatosis and lymphatic leukemia (Kieler, [1951](#B145); Goodwin et al., [1967](#B103)). First generation nitrogen mustards are no longer used, due to the high toxicity and pharmacological resistance mechanisms developed by tumor cells. Presently, the nitrogen mustard mainly used in oncological treatments is cyclophosphamide, a bischloroethylenic compound, able to interfere with the cell cycle of both active and quiescent cells (Friedman and Seligman, [1954](#B91); Lane, [1959](#B156)). Although cyclophosphamide can be used in the treatment of various forms of cancer, it is mostly used for the treatment of neoplastic diseases involving the immune system. It is used in the treatment of lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), neuroblastoma, sarcoma, as well as in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases (Emadi et al., [2009](#B71); Brummaier et al., [2013](#B33); Kim and Chan, [2017](#B147)).\n\nOther alkylating agents are represented by nitrosourea compounds (carmustine, lomustine, semustin, streptozocin, nimustine, tallimustine, photemustine), alkyl sulfates (busulfan, treosulfan, mannosulfan), ethyleneimine derivatives (thiotepa, triazichinone), epoxides (etoglucide), triazene compounds (dacarbazine, temozolomide) and metal salts (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, satraplatin) (Puyo et al., [2014](#B209)). Among these, dacarbazine and platinum compounds are alkylating agents still widely used in the first and second line treatments of various tumors. These agents are used for melanomas, Hodgkin's lymphomas, soft tissue sarcoma, NSCLC, carcinoma of the esophagus, carcinoma of the stomach, bladder cancer, genitourinary tumors, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, and carcinoma of the testis (Lokich, [2001](#B164); Al-Badr and Alodhaib, [2016](#B5)).\n\nIn particular, dacarbazine was first synthesized by Shealy in 1962 and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1975 for the treatment of melanoma and lymphomas (Shealy et al., [1962](#B236)). The discovery of platinum compounds by Rosenberg and colleagues at the Michigan State University took place in 1965, with cisplatin (first generation), and was further implemented with the synthesis of carboplatin (second generation) and oxaliplatin (third generation), which have revolutionized the treatment of several solid tumors, thanks to their broader antitumor activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity (Rosenberg et al., [1965](#B219); Evans et al., [1983](#B74); Rossi et al., [2005](#B222)).\n\n### Antimetabolites\n\nSoon after the Second World War, new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumors have been developed, based on the use of molecules mimicking the structure of physiological metabolites, thereby blocking enzymatic chains essential for the synthesis of purines, which results in inhibition of cell proliferation. The main antimetabolites include folate analogs (aminopterin and methotrexate), purine analogs (mercaptopurine) and pyrimidine analogs (fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine; Kaye, [1998](#B141); Tiwari, [2012](#B250)).\n\nAntifolates were the first class of antimetabolites studied. In 1947, Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, obtained with aminopterin the first complete pharmacological remission in a child affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Following this observation, aminopterin was the first folic acid analog used to reduce tumor cells proliferation and restore the bone marrow homeostasis (Farber et al., [1948](#B78); Thiersch, [1949](#B249)). The remission of acute pediatric leukemia stimulated the research of other antifolate derivatives, which conserved therapeutic efficacy but exerted less toxic effects. Among the various synthesized compounds, methotrexate (amethopterin), a methylated derivative of endopterin, is still one of the most important currently available antineoplastic drugs (Meyer et al., [1950](#B173)).\n\nThe mechanism of action of both aminopterin and methotrexate was not initially clear. Ten years after Faber's findings, antifolates were shown to specifically inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In particular, methotrexate permanently bound DHFR, leading to inhibition of thymidylate and purine synthesis and, subsequently, to the induction of apoptosis (Jolivet et al., [1983](#B138)). This mechanism of action has proven to be very effective in limiting the tumor growth of numerous solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, head and neck, and bladder cancer (Jolivet et al., [1983](#B138)). Furthermore, methotrexate has been shown to lead to complete remission of patients with choriocarcinoma and as adjuvant therapy to prevent the onset of osteosarcoma relapse after surgery (Li et al., [1958](#B160); Jaffe et al., [1974](#B134); Chabner and Roberts, [2005](#B45)).\n\nIn the early '50s, other antimetabolites were synthesized and many of them are still used nowadays. Among these, 6-mercaptopurine and 5-fluorouracil, analogs of purines and pyrimidines, respectively, are widely used in clinical practices for the treatment of both hematological malignances and solid tumors (De Abreu et al., [2000](#B58); Wei et al., [2018](#B267)). In 1954, Skipper and Hitchings studied the purine analogs by developing a drug, 6-mercaptopurine, able to compete with hypoxanthine and guanine for the synthesis of their nucleotide derivatives (Hitchings and Elion, [1954](#B125); Skipper et al., [1954](#B239)). Furthermore, following its conversion into thioinosinic acid (TIMP), 6-mercaptopurine in turn inhibits several enzymatic reactions, including the formation of 5′-adenylic acid (AMP) fundamental for DNA and RNA synthesis. 6-mercaptopurine treatment has been shown to be particularly effective in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nFinally, the pyrimidine analogs made their entry in cancer clinical practice with the introduction of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In 1957, Charles Heidelberger synthesized 5-FU, which has revolutionized the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors with particular reference to colorectal cancer, where 5-FU is still actively used in association with others anticancer drugs in several protocols, such as the FOLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens (Heidelberger et al., [1957](#B121); Carrillo et al., [2015](#B42)).\n\n### Antimitotics of natural origin\n\nThe important medical and pharmacological findings obtained in the early '40s and '50s have revolutionized the therapeutic approaches for cancer, leading to significant improvements in survival rate, especially for patients with onco-hematological diseases (Frei, [1985](#B89)). A new boost to the chemotherapeutic treatment of both hematological and solid tumors has occurred with the introduction in the therapeutic practice of natural extracts with cytotoxic activity, able to interfere with the formation of microtubules and to block the mitotic processes and cell proliferation (van Vuuren et al., [2015](#B255)). These compounds were commonly classified as microtubule-destabilizing agents or microtubule-stabilizing agents (Chen and Horwitz, [2002](#B48)) because they act either by inhibiting the polymerization of microtubules via the interaction with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) or by stabilizing microtubules and prevent Ca2+- or cold-induced depolymerization, with subsequent blockage of mitotic fuse disassembly (Chen and Horwitz, [2002](#B48)).\n\nThe first antimitotic agents discovered in the late '50s were extracted from the plant *Catharanthus roseus* (rosy periwinkle), and took the name of Vinca alkaloids. Vinca alkaloids were firstly used for the treatment of diabetes, but further studies by Noble and colleagues showed the carcinostatic activity against transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma and sarcoma in mouse models (Noble et al., [1958](#B196)). Subsequently, in 1963, Johnson and colleagues elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of Vinca on tumor cell proliferation (Johnson et al., [1963](#B137)). In the following years, numerous Vinca derivatives were synthesized, all with depolymerizing action against microtubules. Among these molecules, those with greater therapeutic efficacy were vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, vindesine, etc. (Jordan and Wilson, [2004](#B139)). All these drugs are still widely used in first and second line therapy for the treatment of various forms of cancer (acute lymphocytic leukemia, malignant lymphomas, multiple myeloma, metastatic breast cancer, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), Ewing's sarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.) representing a relevant pharmacological option for patients developing drug resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, as described at the end of this chapter, Vinca alkaloids are used in several combined therapeutic regimens.\n\nOther natural antimitotic agents are derived from *Podophyllum peltatum* (mayapple, wild mandrake) from which podophyllin is obtained, initially used for the treatment of epitheliomas and sarcomas with a high toxicity. All *Podophyllum* derivatives, called epipodophyllotoxins, determine the arrest of cell proliferation by blocking the topoisomerase II, fundamental for DNA unwinding during the duplication phase (Imbert, [1998](#B130)). Given its generalized toxicity, derivatives with higher selectivity and fewer side effects were obtained, including the recently revoked teniposide (VM-26) and etoposide (VP-16) still used in polychemotherapy schedules for the treatment of SCLC, acute monoblastic leukemia and non-seminomatous testis carcinomas (Minocha and Long, [1984](#B179)).\n\nFinally, the class of antimitotic agents includes topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan, irinotecan) and microtubule stabilizing molecules, of which taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel) represent the most important compounds (Oberlies and Kroll, [2004](#B197)). In particular, irinotecan is the latest derivative of camptothecin, extracted from an ornamental Chinese tree, *Camptotheca acuminate* (happy tree, cancer tree, or tree of life), in 1966 by Wall and Wani at the Research Triangle Institute (Wall et al., [1966](#B264)). Irinotecan has been shown to have much more effective antitumor activity than first-generation camptothecins and less renal toxicity. Since 1996, irinotecan has been approved for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma, alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil or platinum compounds, and subsequently also used for the treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancer (Rothenberg, [1996](#B224); Rosen, [1998](#B217)).\n\nFive years later, in 1971, the same research group of Wall and Wani described the molecular structure of taxol, a natural compound with antimitotic properties extracted from the tree *Taxus brevifolia* (Pacific yew or western yew, Wani et al., [1971](#B266)). However, only in 1979, Susan B. Horwitz and her research group described the mechanism of action of Taxol, highlighting its activity as microtubule stabilizer (Schiff et al., [1979](#B231)). Several drugs have been derived from the Taxol. The progenitor is represented by paclitaxel, still used in clinical practice. Later on, second- (docetaxel) and third-generation (cabazitaxel) derivatives were developed (Bissery et al., [1991](#B22); Mita et al., [2009](#B180)). All these compounds have revolutionized the treatment of several solid tumors including metastatic breast cancer, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (in association with gemcitabine), NSCLC (in association with carboplatin), head and neck cancer, gastric and prostatic cancer. In particular, these drugs are used when the first line treatment failed in metastatic patients and therefore represent the only therapeutic option for patients who show drug resistance mechanisms or are not candidates for curative surgical interventions (Ojima et al., [2016](#B198)).\n\n### Cytotoxic antibiotics and related substances\n\nAmong the standard chemotherapeutic drugs, there are also some antibiotics and/or their derivatives with marked cytotoxic activity, which are among the most effective anticancer drugs currently used in different therapeutic regimens (Weiss, [1992](#B268)). A wide range of natural antibiotics displays cytotoxic effects; their main mechanism of action is to form covalent bonds with nucleic acids, interfering with DNA synthesis. The first anti-tumor antibiotic used was puromycin. This is an analog of the adenine capable of integrating within the tRNA molecules on ribosomes and blocking protein synthesis by premature termination of the amino acid chain. However, puromycin was not widely used due to its non-selectivity and high systemic toxicity (Wright et al., [1955](#B272)).\n\nThe discovery of the antitumor properties of the currently used antibiotics in cancer is the result of the active collaboration between European pharmaceutical companies and renowned International cancer research centers (Cassinelli, [2016](#B44)).\n\nThe discovery of anthracyclines is the result of the scientific agreement between the Farmitalia and the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan directed by Bucalossi. For the first time, a research center and a company worked together for the discovery and development of a new drug with anticancer properties. For this purpose, in 1960 the constituted workgroup started to study a Streptomyces strain, *Streptomyces peucetius*, found near Castel del Monte (Apulia). A new natural antitumor drug, called daunomycin (in a second moment called daunorubicin), was obtained from this Streptomyces strain and showed higher efficacy compared to others antitumor drugs in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases (Di Marco et al., [1963](#B62); Bonadonna et al., [1968](#B26)). Subsequently, in 1968, a new molecule was extracted from a mutated strain of *Streptomyces peucetius*, obtained by treating the microorganism with N-Nitroso-N-methylurea. This new antitumor drug, named adriamycin, was eventually renamed doxorubicin. The discovery of doxorubicin is the result of the collaborative effort of Farmitalia, the researchers of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori and of researchers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Doxorubicin showed better activity against tumors in mouse and a greater therapeutic index, however, the cardiotoxicity typical of anthracycline was not eliminated (Arcamone et al., [1969](#B11); Di Marco et al., [1969](#B63)). The mechanism of action of anthracyclines consists in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis by interfering with the topoisomerase II enzyme, preventing the relaxing of supercoiled DNA and thus blocking DNA transcription and replication (Hortobágyi, [1997](#B126)).\n\nAround the mid-‘50s, the anti-tumor antibiotic actinomycin D was obtained from another strain of Streptomyces, *Streptomyces griseus*. This drug was used for the treatment of some sarcomas, choriocarcinoma, and lymphomas. Another anti-tumor drug is the mithramycin belonging to the group of DNA intercalates with high specificity for bone tumors and bone metastases (Kersten et al., [1966](#B144)).\n\nFinally, another antitumor antibiotic, still widely used in clinical practice today, is bleomycin, discovered in Japan in 1966 and immediately approved for the treatment of various tumors, such as Hodgkin's and NHL, testicular cancer, and cervical cancer, among others (Umezawa et al., [1966](#B254); Chen and Stubbe, [2005](#B47); Bolzán and Bianchi, [2018](#B25)).\n\n### Other anti-cancer drugs: polyamine inhibitors and iron-modulating drugs\n\nCell proliferation and tumor growth are promoted by several stimulating factors including polyamines, organic compounds bearing two or more amino groups, responsible for cell growth, gene transcription, translation, and chromatin remodeling (Miller-Fleming et al., [2015](#B177)). On these bases, new synthetic drugs were developed in order to prevent the formation of polyamines by inhibiting their synthesis or prevent their transport across the cell membrane. The first polyamine inhibitor, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, was synthesized in the 1970s and was used in clinical practices in 1980 for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and other parasitic infections (Abdel-Monem et al., [1974](#B1); Bacchi et al., [1980](#B15)). Among the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is the most widely used both for parasitic infections, excess of facial hair in women, and chemotherapy. DFMO was firstly used in cancer therapy in 1981 for the treatment of kidney and bladder cancer in order to induce the reduction of tumor growth (Dunzendorfer, [1981](#B69)). Subsequently, numerous studies showed the clinical efficacy of the treatment with DFMO in several cancer types (Gerner and Meyskens, [2004](#B94); Damiani and Wallace, [2018](#B57)). Despite the success of DFMO, DFMO treated cells often up-regulate polyamine transport activity making the treatment ineffective. For this purpose, other molecules, called polyamine transport inhibitors (PTIs), have been produced against polyamine transporters at the cell membrane level. Today these inhibitors are generally used in combination with the DFMO showing that combination therapy is more effective in reducing intracellular polyamine levels, thereby limiting tumor growth (Muth et al., [2014](#B189)).\n\nOther anti-cancer drugs were developed to regulate the intracellular levels of iron, whose alteration may lead to cancer development. Notably, iron is an essential micronutrient for cellular homeostasis. Iron deficiency is often associated with anemia, while iron increased levels induce oxidative stress to tissues, leading to inflammation, system dysfunction that may lead to genetic alteration and consequently neoplastic transformation. Accordingly, numerous studies tried to develop new iron-modulating agents for the treatment of cancer patients. One of the used iron-modulating anti-cancer drugs is desferrioxamine (DFX), an iron chelator that reduces iron levels and consequently its metabolism, which affects the methylation levels in CRC model (Cao et al., [2018](#B40)). Among iron chelators, there are also di-2-pyridylketone-4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), ciclopirox, and triapine, for which several clinical trials are undergoing (Fischer-Fodor et al., [2015](#B86)). In particular, triapine is one of the most used drugs in clinical oncology for the treatment of several solid tumors, including uterine cervix and vaginal cancers, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and advanced/metastatic solid tumors (Fischer-Fodor et al., [2015](#B86)).\n\n### Combination chemotherapy regimens\n\nDuring the ‘60s and the ‘70s, new combined therapeutic protocols using several chemotherapeutic drugs with different mechanisms of action began to be proposed in clinical practice.\n\nThe use of combined chemotherapy or anticancer polychemotherapy has represented an epochal turning point for the treatment of tumors, because achieves greater therapeutic efficacy than the use of single chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, combination therapy kills a larger number of tumor cells with a higher dose of each single drug, therefore not exceeding the maximum tolerated doses of each single drug. Furthermore, it guarantees a wider range of interaction between drugs and cancer cells with different genetic abnormalities. Finally, it is able to prevent or slow down the subsequent development of drug resistance (Lilenbaum et al., [2005](#B162)).\n\nIn 1964, for the first time, Vincent De Vita and his collaborators, at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, proposed a combined approach for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. This first combination was named MOPP, from the initials of the four antitumor agents used: Mustargen (mechlorethamine), Oncovin (also known as Vincristine); Procarbazine and Prednisone (Moxley et al., [1967](#B185)). The use of MOPP regimen achieved important therapeutic results, with complete remission in 80% of patients and no signs and symptoms of disease in the following 5 years for 60% of patients (De Vita et al., [1970](#B60)). This study represented a milestone in the treatment not only for malignant lymphomas, but also for other cancers.\n\nIn the following years, thanks to studies carried out in animal models, it was shown that chemotherapeutic drugs were more effective against small tumors and when used in combination, thus establishing the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment of tumors in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens. Based on these studies, new combined treatments were proposed. In June 1972, Gianni Bonadonna and Umberto Veronesi proposed a study to evaluate the efficacy of an adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, based on the combination of three drugs Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and Fluorouracil, named CMF, which improved the probability of survival of cancer patients (De Lena et al., [1973](#B59)). In 1973, Bonadonna and some of his collaborators proposed a new combination of four drugs, Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine, named ABVD after their initials, for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The results demonstrated that, even years later, the ABVD combination healed more patients than MOPP alone and was better tolerated, with minor side effects (Bonadonna et al., [1975](#B27)).\n\nThese first studies on the efficacy of combination therapy have paved the way for the development of numerous therapeutic regimens, still used today, that have proven to be more effective than treatment with individual antitumor drugs. In the following years, the clinical importance of the relationship between the dose intensity and therapeutic efficacy of the administered drugs was confirmed and the first therapeutic protocols based on bone marrow transplantation in leukemic patients were developed.\n\nThe discoveries in the field of molecular biology gave a major impulse to develop new targeted therapies and new selective biological drugs, specific for certain tumors. These discoveries prompted the second pharmacological revolution in cancer therapy, that began in ‘80s, with the development of selective kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n## The revolution of targeted therapy: selective kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies\n\nAt the beginning of the ‘80s, the new discoveries in the field of immunology, cell biology, and molecular biology allowed the researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neoplastic transformation of cells and thus identify new molecular targets to be blocked by small selective inhibitory molecules or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, unlike the classic chemotherapy approach, which acts on both normal cells and cancer cells, the targeted therapy intervenes on altered key oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes involved in tumor promotion. By this way, these new selective inhibitors are able to affect only altered cancer cells with minor side effects toward the normal cells (Hartmann et al., [2009](#B119)).\n\nNowadays, the term “targeted therapy” refers to all those treatments affecting specific molecular targets; this approach takes advantage of either small molecules obtained by chemical synthesis or biological drugs (also called biotechnological drugs), i.e., recombinant proteins, mainly monoclonal antibodies, directed toward specific cellular receptors and proteins involved in neoplastic processes (Tsimberidou, [2015](#B251); Figure [3](#F3)).\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/37d1de8f87fe/fphar-09-01300-g0003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=6243123_fphar-09-01300-g0003.jpg)\n\n![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4ec1/6243123/37d1de8f87fe/fphar-09-01300-g0003.jpg)\n\nMolecular targets of targeted therapy. Targeted therapy for cancer treatment is based on tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Protein kinase inhibitors are divided into EGFR inhibitors, VEGFR inhibitors, BCR/ABL inhibitors, ALK/EML4 inhibitors, RAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies are directed toward extracellular growth factors or extracellular receptor tyrosine kinase. Figure [3](#F3) has been adapted and enriched by taking a cue from two published papers by Massimo Libra, co-author of the present review (Russo et al., [2014](#B226); Leonardi et al., [2018](#B159)). For the general structure of Figure [3](#F3) and the name of drugs, the information contained in the book “Farmacologia: Principi di base e applicazioni terapeutiche” was taken into account (Rossi et al., [2016](#B223)). ABL, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog; AKT, protein kinase B; ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase; BAD, Bcl-2-associated death promoter; BCR, breakpoint cluster region; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EML4, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4; ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinases; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase; RAS, RAS proto-oncogene GTPase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; S6K, S6 kinase; src, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.\n\nThe discoveries of 1975 by George Köhler and César Milstein have opened the way for the production of several specific hybrid monoclonal antibodies specific to different antigens or cellular targets, obtained by the realization of hybridomas, resulting from the fusion of murine B lymphocytes and human myeloma cells, capable of producing large quantities of monoclonal antibodies (Köhler and Milstein, [1975](#B150)).\n\nThe first targeted approach to the treatment of cancer dates back to the early ‘80s, with the development of a monoclonal antibody tested on murine models (Bernstein et al., [1980](#B21)). In 1980, Nadler and colleagues treated a patient affected by NHL with the murine monoclonal antibody AB89, but the treatment did not induce a significant clinical response (Nadler et al., [1980](#B190)). Nevertheless, this was the first attempt of targeted therapy by using a monoclonal antibody able to selectively target tumor cells and to induce cell death by direct or indirect mechanisms. These two mechanisms of action are respectively defined as the direct inhibition of a molecular pathway involved in tumor progression or the enhancement of host defense mechanisms through activation of the antibody-dependent cytotoxic pathway and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (Oldham, [1983](#B199); O'Mahony and Bishop, [2006](#B200)).\n\nOther attempts to develop effective monoclonal antibodies against myelo- and linfo-proliferative diseases and lymphomas have taken place over the ‘80s, but without results convincing enough to justify their use in clinical practice (Miller et al., [1982](#B176)). In particular, since most antibodies were murine, they induced host immune reactions against the administered drug, with subsequent side effects (allergic/anaphylactic reactions) and enhanced clearance/reduced half-life (Dillman et al., [1986](#B66); Kornbrot et al., [1994](#B151)).\n\nIt was only in the ‘90s that the first really effective targeted therapy drugs became available. The breakthrough was made possible thanks to the studies on the human genome, and the advancement in technologies for DNA sequencing, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, invaluable for recognizing new molecular targets (Tsimberidou, [2015](#B251)). Moreover, in those years, thanks to the new knowledge in molecular and cellular fields and the advancement of the technologies for drug discovery, we have witnessed the birth of modern targeted therapy and personalized medicine. As described below, the possibility of having effective and specific drugs against growth factors and their receptors, cytoplasmic proteins, and signal transducers altered in specific tumor pathologies lead to significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy and survival rates of cancer patients.\n\n### Monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy\n\nSince the discovery of Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and the first clinical trials performed in 1992, several monoclonal antibodies were discovered and introduced in cancer clinical practice. As previously mentioned, Köhler and Milstein ([1975](#B150)) revolutionized anti-cancer therapeutics with the development of hybridoma technology, used to produce monoclonal antibodies. Initially, the produced monoclonal antibodies were mouse antibodies. Subsequently, thanks to the new genetic engineering techniques, it was possible to obtain different types of monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of both hematological and solid tumors. In particular, there are 4 types of monoclonal antibodies available: murine, chimeric, humanized and human monoclonal antibodies, which differ each other by the percentage of murine protein portion present in the immunoglobulin (Pento, [2017](#B204)).\n\nAccording to the last report of the “Animal Cell Technology Industrial Platform” (ACTIP), in 2017, 30 different monoclonal antibodies were approved by FDA and/or EMA for the treatment of hematological and solid tumors and others will be approved in the near future; others 6 antibodies were approved for the diagnosis of cancers (Table [2](#T2); ACTIP, [2017](#B3)).\n\n#### Table 2.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies approved by the EMA and FDA for cancer treatment and diagnosis −2017 Update.\n\n| **Trade name** | **Active principle name** | **Company** | **Target** | **Type** | **Year of EU EMA approval** | **Year of FDA approval** | **Therapeutic indication(s)** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bavencio® | Avelumab | Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited | PD-L1 | Human IgG1/κ | Not approved[\\*](#TN3) | 2017 | Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma |\n| Imfinzi® | Durvalumab | Astrazeneca UK | PD-L1 | Human IgG1/κ | Not approved[\\*](#TN3) | 2017 | Metastatic urothelial carcinoma |\n| Lartruvo | Olaratumab | Eli Lilly | PDGFR-α | Human IgG1 | 2016 | 2016 | Sarcoma |\n| Darzalex® | Daratumumab | Janssen-Cilag | CD38 | Human IgG1/κ | 2016 | 2015 | Multiple myeloma |\n| Empliciti | Elotuzumab | Bristol-Myers Squibb | SLAMF7 | Human IgG1 | 2016 | 2015 | Multiple myeloma |\n| Portrazza | Necitumumab | Eli Lilly | EGFR | Human IgG1 | 2016 | 2015 | Carcinoma, non-small-cell lung |\n| Tecentriq® | Atezolizumab | Genentech (Roche) | PD-L1 | Human IgG1 | Not approved[\\*](#TN3) | 2016 | Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer |\n| Opdivo | Nivolumab | Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma | PD-1 | Human IgG4 | 2015 | 2015 | Carcinoma;

Withdrawn from the market in EU in 2005*.\n\nBoth EMA and FDA have released various regulatory guidelines concerning development, clinical experimentation, approval and subsequent commercialization of monoclonal antibodies used in anti-tumor therapies. In particular, in September 2017 EMA released the fifth version of the “Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man” providing the guidance for the development of anti-cancer drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, in all stages of their clinical development (European Medicine Agency, [2016](#B72), [2017](#B73)). According to EMA, the development of a monoclonal antibody is a multi-step process composed by *in vitro* non-clinical studies performed to elucidate the prime activity of the drug and subsequent pre-clinical studies in animal models and clinical trials in tumor patients to assess the pharmacokinetics, clearance, activity and response to monoclonal antibody treatments (European Medicine Agency, [2016](#B72), [2017](#B73)). Regarding FDA regulations, a document containing all the guidance for the production and regulation of monoclonal antibody drugs was published in 1997, “Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use” (Food Drug Administration, [1997](#B87)). Subsequently, several drafts were approved and published by FDA, but the 1997 document still remains the the main reference text for development and production of new monoclonal antibodies used in oncology and for the treatment of other diseases.\n\nAs mentioned above, Trastuzumab was the first monoclonal antibody tested in a clinical trial (1992) directed toward the mutated HER2/neu receptor of breast cancer (Carter et al., [1992](#B43)). However, the approval of this drug by the regulatory agencies took place only in 1998 (Miller, [1998](#B174)). Because of this delay, the first approved monoclonal antibody was Rituximab (Rituxan® and MabThera®), approved in 1997, a year earlier than Trastuzumab. The introduction of both Rituximab and Trastuzumab have represented landmark events in the revolution of anti-tumor treatments.\n\nIn particular, the first experiments on Rituximab were carried out in 1994 by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which, inspired by the studies conducted on murine monoclonal antibodies against the surface antigen CD-20, developed a chimeric monoclonal antibody, named IDEC-C2B8, able to determine the killing of B-cells in both monkeys and B-cell lymphoma patients (Maloney et al., [1994](#B169); Reff et al., [1994](#B212)). Subsequently, in 1997, FDA gave the final approval for the use of this antibody also in patients affected by lymphoproliferative B lymphocyte disorders.\n\nAfter the approval, all the phase II and III clinical trials showed the promising effects of Rituximab in the treatment of several types of refractory NHLs, including mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (Coiffier et al., [1998](#B53)). Others studies showed that high doses of Rituximab were well-tolerated by patients affected by indolent NHL and were able to induce the remission of pathology in a high percentage of patients (Ghielmini et al., [2004](#B96); Hainsworth et al., [2005](#B113)). Furthermore, in 2002, a combination therapy including Rituximab and CHOP standard chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (also called doxorubicin), Oncovin (vincristine), and Prednisone or Prednisolone) was proposed (Coiffier et al., [2002](#B54); Mounier et al., [2003](#B184)). The so-called R-CHOP regimen has shown a significant outcome improvement for patients affected by NHLs. Another antibody directed to the CD-20 receptor is Tositumomab, a murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody, produced in mammalian cells. This monoclonal antibody was eventually conjugated with iodine 131 (Iodine I 131 Tositumomab). Both labeled and unlabeled Tositumomab are approved for the treatment of Rituximab-refractory NHLs (Quackenbush et al., [2015](#B210)).\n\nRegarding Trastuzumab, it is a humanized monoclonal antibody obtained by genetic engineering technologies, able to inhibit the activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu, a glycoprotein receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, which, when altered, promotes breast cancer cells growth. Beside receptor blockade, Trastuzumab is able to induce cancer cell death by Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key mechanism also exploited by other monoclonal antibodies (Hudes et al., [2007](#B128)). Trastuzumab was obtained by Ullrich and Shepard at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (Shepard et al., [1991](#B237)). Subsequent collaboration between Genentech and UCLA scaled up the development of Trastuzumab that was used in the first clinical trial in 1992 (Carter et al., [1992](#B43)).\n\nThe results obtained by the first phase I and II trials suggest that Trastuzumab, through the repression of the HER2/neu receptor, reduced the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, these studies showed that Trastuzumab was effective when used in monotherapy as well as in combination with platinum compounds (Baselga et al., [1996](#B19); Pegram et al., [1998](#B203)). The effectiveness and safety of Trastuzumab have made it the gold standard treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer, alone or in combination with paclitaxel or doxorubicin, and for patients affected by HER2-positive metastatic gastric carcinoma (Müller et al., [2018](#B188)). Finally, in 2013 a conjugated monoclonal antibody was approved, named Trastuzumab-emtansine. This is an antibody-drug conjugate composed by the monoclonal antibody Herceptin chemically linked with the antimitotic agent emtansine (DM1 or mertansine; Niculescu-Duvaz, [2010](#B195); LoRusso et al., [2011](#B166)). This drug showed a higher efficacy compared to Trastuzumab alone because while the monoclonal antibody inhibits the cell growth through its interaction with the HER2/neu receptor and subsequent inhibition of both MAPK and PI3K/AKT cellular signaling pathways, emtansine entries the cell and binds to tubulin, preventing the duplication of DNA (Barok et al., [2014](#B18)). The first clinical trials showed that Trastuzumab-emtansine significantly improves patient's progression-free survival (PFS) (14.2 months, compared to 9.2 months for patients treated with the standard regimen Trastuzumab plus docetaxel; Hurvitz et al., [2013](#B129)).\n\nThe HER2/neu receptor is also the target of another humanized monoclonal antibody, Pertuzumab (Perjeta®), used in patients affected by HER2-positive metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab is often administered in association with Trastuzumab and docetaxel in adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens (Schneeweiss et al., [2013](#B232)). Pertuzumab was discovered and developed by Genentech and then approved in 2012. Similar to Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab is a HER dimerization inhibitor; in particular it prevents the dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors thus inhibiting intracellular phosphorylation events, which subsequently blocks the abnormal cell growth and proliferation (Harbeck et al., [2013](#B118)).\n\nThe third monoclonal antibody directed to surface receptors discovered in order of time is Cetuximab (Erbitux®) directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), frequently altered in numerous tumors, especially colorectal carcinomas, NSCLC and head and neck cancers (Vokes and Chu, [2006](#B261)). Cetuximab is a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal antibody with a 5- to 10-fold higher affinity for EGFR compared to the endogenous ligands. Its mechanism of action consists in the inhibition of EGFR signaling transduction pathway resulting in the block of cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and invasion; furthermore, Cetuximab is able to promote ADCC cytotoxicity and to induce EGFR internalization, resulting in down-regulation of EGFR itself (Vincenzi et al., [2010](#B259)). Since 1988, Sela and collaborators have studied a monoclonal antibody directed to EGFR and observed a significant therapeutic effect in cellular and pre-clinical models of human carcinomas (Aboud-Pirak et al., [1988](#B2)). Later on, thanks again to the support of a pharmaceutical company, Cetuximab entered clinical development and showed immediately important results in of phase II and III clinical trials carried out on patients affected by colorectal carcinomas, NSCLC and head and neck cancers (Robert et al., [2001](#B215); Kim, [2004](#B146); Saltz et al., [2004](#B229)). This treatment, however, is effective only in the subset of patients without activating mutation of KRAS gene (Lièvre et al., [2006](#B161)).\n\nIn the following years, another human monoclonal antibody, Panitumumab (Vectibix®), directed to EGFR was developed. In 2006, Panitumumab was approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS and refractory to standard chemotherapeutic regimens (Poulin-Costello et al., [2013](#B207)).\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies described above, with the exception of Rituximab directed against the CD-20 differentiation cluster, are all directed to extracellular receptors responsible for the activation of various molecular pathways that have, as their final effect, the increase in cell proliferation and/or inhibition of apoptosis (Fauvel and Yasri, [2014](#B80)). Another monoclonal antibody widely used for the treatment of different types of solid tumors is Bevacizumab (Avastin®) a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed to a soluble growth factor and not to a receptor. Indeed, Bevacizumab blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) representing the first anti-angiogenic factor to be developed (Chen et al., [2001](#B46)).\n\nThe discovery and development of Bevacizumab began with studies by Senger in 1983, who for the first time identified the vascular endothelial growth factor responsible for neovascularization observed in rodents' tumors (Senger et al., [1983](#B235)). Subsequently, in 1989 the research group directed by Napoleone Ferrara purified and cloned VEGF (Ferrara and Henzel, [1989](#B82)), starting the development of Bevacizumab (Presta et al., [1997](#B208)).\n\nThe discovery of Bevacizumab and its use in clinical practice represented an epochal turning point for the first and second line treatment of numerous metastatic solid tumors, for which no effective treatments were yet available. The first clinical trials (1997) showed that bevacizumab, used as a single agent, was well-tolerated by patients and when administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents did not lead to an increase in systemic toxicity (Gordon et al., [2001](#B104)). Further phase II and III clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of Bevacizumab, administered alone, for patients with renal cell carcinoma, or, in combination with standard chemotherapy, for patients with colorectal carcinoma and NSCLC (Ferrara et al., [2004](#B83)).\n\nToday Bevacizumab is used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, advanced or metastatic breast cancer, advanced metastatic lung cancer, advanced and/or metastatic renal carcinoma, epithelial ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tubes carcinoma, peritoneal carcinoma and recurrent or metastatic cervix carcinoma (Keating, [2014](#B142)).\n\nOther antibodies used for the treatment of tumors are: Brentuximab (Adcetris®), Ofatumumab (Arzerra®), Alemtuzumab (Campath®), Obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro®), Elotuzumab (Empliciti) and Daratumumab (Darzalex®) for the treatment of hematological malignancies (REF); Avelumab (Bavencio®), Durvalumab (Imfinzi®); Olaratumab (Latruvo), Necitumumab (Potrazza), Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), Dinutuximab (Unituxin), Ramucirumab (Cyramza), Denosumab (Xgeva®), Catumaxomab (Removab®) for the treatment of several solid tumors (Table [2](#T2)).\n\nFurthermore, some of these monoclonal antibodies are used for diagnostic purposes (Zhang et al., [2014](#B278)) and others have been conjugated with cytotoxic molecules or radioactive isotopes, to specifically direct their high toxic activity against tumor cells (Beck et al., [2017](#B20); Table [2](#T2)).\n\nOther monoclonal antibodies developed since 2011 and directed against immune checkpoint inhibitors (Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab) will be discussed in more detail in the following chapter on immunotherapy.\n\n### Selective tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine-protein kinase small molecules inhibitors\n\nAs stated before, several molecular pathways are altered in cancer because of gene mutations and protein modifications that lead to the abnormal activation of intracellular signal transduction, such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, resulting in the increase of cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, cell dedifferentiation, and cell migration (McCubrey et al., [2010](#B171)). The study of these molecular alterations has led to the development of chemical small molecules able to selectively bind to molecular targets present in the tumor cells, causing their inhibition and cancer cell death by apoptotic mechanisms.\n\nThe selective inhibitors are generally divided into two main categories: selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors and intracytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase inhibitors (Wu et al., [2015](#B273)). The new targets include growth factors, signaling molecules, cell-cycle proteins, modulators of apoptosis and molecules that promote angiogenesis. At the beginning of the '90s there was a growing industrial and scientific interest in developing new selective drugs for specific molecular targets known to be involved in cancer development; such growing interest has fostered both the efficacy of new cancer treatments and the economic development of pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of anticancer drugs (Lange et al., [2014](#B157); Diaby et al., [2015](#B65)).\n\nThe landmark event in the revolution of targeted therapy was represented by the development in the early '90s of the first selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (Glivec®), a specific competitive inhibitor of ATP, directed to the fusion protein BCR-ABL typical of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and ALL that are Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+). Before the discovery of Imatinib several compounds were obtained for the inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, among these Tyrphostins and similar compounds that displayed limited specificity (Anafi et al., [1993](#B7); Waller, [2018](#B265)). Subsequently, in 1996, Buchdunger and colleagues synthesized a tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective against the ABL tyrosine kinase domain called 2-phenylaminopyrimidine or STI571 or Imatinib mesylate (Buchdunger et al., [1996](#B36); Druker et al., [1996](#B67)). Further studies demonstrated that Imatinib, beside BCR-ABL, is also able to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR), also known as proto-oncogene c-Kit, frequently mutated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (Buchdunger et al., [2000](#B35); Tuveson et al., [2001](#B253)).\n\nSeveral clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Imatinib in patients affected by CML, ALL, and GIST. In particular, Imatinib is able to induce the complete remission in CML patients refractory to other treatments. The phase III IRIS clinical trial confirmed the efficacy of Imatinib in patients with CML in chronic phase (Hahn et al., [2003](#B112)). Other clinical trials were performed to assess the efficacy of Imatinib against c-KIT and PDGF receptor in patients affected by advanced and/or metastatic GIST tumor showing a good response rate and consequently an increased overall survival (OS) (Dagher et al., [2002](#B56); Blanke et al., [2008](#B24)). After Imatinib discovery, some studies showed that a percentage of patients were resistant *ab initio* to treatment with Glivec due to the presence of specific mutated variants of BRC-ABL, while some patients developed resistances during treatment (Milojkovic and Apperley, [2009](#B178)). To cope with the poor efficacy of Imatinib treatment in this category of patients, new second and third generation BCR-ABL inhibitors were developed, including Dasatinib (Sprycel®), Nilotinib (Tasigna®), Bosutinib (Bosulif®) and Ponatinib (Iclusig®) (Rossari et al., [2018](#B221)).\n\nThe second class of small molecules directed to tyrosine kinase proteins was represented by Gefitinib (Iressa®) and Erlotinib (Tarceva®) both directed to the EGFR ATP-binding site and able to inhibit the abnormal activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways overexpressed in cancer cells (Nicholson et al., [2001](#B194); Yarden, [2001](#B275)).\n\nThe first anti-EGFR agent approved in 2001 for the treatment of NSCLC was Gefitinib, a potent and selective inhibitor of both EGFR and HER-2 kinases (Barker et al., [2001](#B17)). In preclinical studies, Gefitinib demonstrated antitumor activity in several human cancer cell lines over-expressing EGFR, including lung, ovarian, breast, and colon cancer cell lines (Ciardiello et al., [2000](#B52)). Currently, Gefitinib is used for the treatment of NSCLC. The first clinical trials recorded a partial remission in 10–15% of patients with NSCLC (Kris et al., [2003](#B153)) although it showed reduced efficacy when administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The second EGFR selective inhibitor was Erlotinib, with a mechanism of action similar to Gefitinib. Erlotinib is approved for the treatment of NSCLC and for advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, in association with gemcitabine. Both Gefitinib and Erlotinib do not induce complete remission but do increase OS rate and limit tumor growth (Steins et al., [2018](#B245)).\n\nAnother specific inhibitor of HER1 and HER2, approved in 2007, is Lapatinib (Tiverb®), developed against HER2 receptors. Lapatinib is able to bind the ATP-binding site of the HER2 receptor intracellular domain resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell growth. Through the introduction of targeted therapy, with both Trastuzumab and Lapatinib, the poor prognosis of HER2-positive cancer patients has been significantly ameliorated (Slamon et al., [2001](#B240)). Currently, based on numerous clinical trials, Lapatinib is used in association with several chemotherapeutic agents, such as capecitabine (Geyer et al., [2006](#B95)) or trastuzumab (Blackwell et al., [2012](#B23)) in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Despite the important clinical results obtained with Lapatinib, today it is used as a third or fourth line treatment, after more effective treatments, such as Trastuzumab-emtansine, or Neratinib, another irreversible pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Voigtlaender et al., [2018](#B260)).\n\nAnother class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is represented by VEGF inhibitors, able to inhibit also other receptors, such as PDGFR, KIT and FLT3. The first two chemical small molecules synthesized and directed to the ATP binding pocket of VEGF receptor were Sunitinib (Sutent®) and Sorafenib (Nexavar®) (Ivy et al., [2009](#B132)).\n\nAs anti-angiogenic drugs, both Sunitinib and Sorafenib are widely used in tumors for which few effective treatments are available and in advanced diseases after the failure of standard chemotherapy (Herrmann et al., [2008](#B122); Ivy et al., [2009](#B132)). In particular, Sunitinib has been approved for the treatment of Imatinib-resistant GIST, renal carcinoma and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, while Sorafenib is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma (Imbulgoda et al., [2014](#B131); Hasskarl, [2018](#B120)).\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, both FDA (January 2006) and EMA (July 2006) approved Sunitinib malate for the treatment of Imatinib-resistant GIST and advanced renal cell carcinoma. As mentioned, Sunitinib appears to inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinases by interfering with the ATP binding site. In particular, Sunitinib inhibits the activity of VEGF receptors 1 and 2, Kit, PDGFR-α, and –β, Fms-like TK-3 (FLT3); colony-stimulating factor receptor type 1 and neurotrophic factor receptor 7. By this way, Sunitinib is able to modulate tumor growth directly, by inhibiting the activation of signal transduction, and indirectly, by preventing tumor neo-vascularization (Adams and Leggas, [2007](#B4)). Several *in vitro* studies showed the efficacy of Sunitinib in different tumor types, including colon, NSCLC, glioma, melanoma, etc. (Mendel et al., [2003](#B172)). However, clinical trials showed Sunitinib more effective in patients with renal cell carcinoma and in those with acute myelogenous leukemia with FLT3 mutations (Fiedler et al., [2005](#B85); Motzer et al., [2006](#B182)).\n\nA few years before the approval of Sunitinib, Sorafenib, a small chemical molecule able to inhibit VEGF and PDGF receptors, was approved by the regulatory agencies. This drug was initially developed as a direct inhibitor of RAF-1 and BRAF intracytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases. Sorafenib was initially developed in 2001 (approved in 2004) by Bayer Pharmaceuticals as a selective inhibitor of both mutated and wild-type RAF, and *in vitro* showed a strong inhibitory power toward MAPKs pathway regulated by RAF. Subsequently, an inhibitory activity was also demonstrated for VEGFR1/2 and PDFGR in several *in vitro* models (Wilhelm et al., [2004](#B270)). Further phase I, II, and III clinical trials showed the efficacy of Sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma patients, hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and thyroid cancer patients thanks to the multiple inhibition of VEGFR, PDGFR and BRAF (Strumberg et al., [2005](#B246); Gupta-Abramson et al., [2008](#B109); Llovet et al., [2008](#B163)).\n\nOther anti-angiogenic drugs are Aflibercept and Pegaptanib sodium, respectively a chimeric protein and an aptamer both directed against VEGF (Lytvynchuk et al., [2015](#B167)).\n\nA class of selective small molecules completely different from those discussed so far is that of mTOR inhibitors. mTOR is an intracellular serine/threonine kinase that plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression and in the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. The first mTOR inhibitor was rapamycin derived from *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. The two drugs currently used in the field of oncology, Temsirolimus (Torisel®) and Everolimus (Afinitor®) were derived from rapamycin (Sirolimus) and are still used in different tumor forms, such as renal cell carcinoma, mantle cell lymphoma, breast cancer and neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinoma (Fasolo and Sessa, [2012](#B79)). mTOR was discovered by studying the mechanism of action of rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic discovered in 1975 (Vézina et al., [1975](#B257)). Rapamycin anticancer activities were defined in the '90s when it was found that it inhibited cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression by blocking mTOR/mTORC1 complex (Jayaraman and Marks, [1993](#B136); Carew et al., [2011](#B41)).\n\nTemsirolimus, previously named cell cycle inhibitor-779, is a soluble ester of rapamycin, identified in the ‘90s and subsequently used as an anticancer agent (Peralba et al., [2003](#B205)). Everolimus, previously named RAD001, is a derivative of rapamycin able to bind FKBP12 and inhibit the mTORC1 complex, resulting in the down-regulation of the PI3K signal transduction pathway, which is frequently activated in human malignancies (Hasskarl, [2018](#B120)). Both drugs showed great efficacy in the clinical trials. Temsirolimus showed anti-tumor activities toward several preclinical tumor models and in phase I–III trials for advanced renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma (Neshat et al., [2001](#B193); Yu et al., [2001](#B276); Hudes et al., [2007](#B128); Ansell et al., [2008](#B9)). More recently, Everolimus also showed a great anti-tumor activity both *in vitro* and in preclinical tumor models (O'Reilly et al., [2010](#B201)). Several clinical trials have tried to assess the efficacy of Everolimus in hematological and solid tumors and some of them have provided encouraging results for its clinical use (Hasskarl, [2018](#B120)).\n\nAmong the selective serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors (Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (Trametinib and Cobimetinib) are widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of mutated *BRAF**V*600*E* melanomas, providing significant improvement in survival rates (Robert et al., [2015](#B214)). Both Vemurafenib (Zelboraf® or PLX4032) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar®) were approved after 2010 and are directed toward RAF protein, belonging to the RAS signal transduction pathway. The 15% of melanoma patients harbor RAS mutations and another 40–60% of patients are positive to the *BRAF**V*600*E* mutations. Therefore, the discovery of selective BRAF inhibitors represented a turning point in the management of this aggressive form of tumor. Both Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib induce melanoma cell apoptosis by interfering with the B-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Despite several clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of these treatments in patients positive for *BRAF**V*600*E* mutation, resistance mechanisms limit the efficacy of the therapy in a high percentage of patients (Leonardi et al., [2018](#B159); Salemi et al., [2018](#B228)).\n\nTo overcome these resistance mechanisms, BRAF inhibitors are generally combined with MEK inhibitors, such as Trametinib (Mekinist®) and/or Cobimetinib (Cotellic®) (Robert et al., [2015](#B214); Ascierto et al., [2016](#B14)). Both Trametinib and Cobimetinib were approved in the last 5 years and are indicated for the treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma in order to avoid tumor relapse after surgical excision (Long et al., [2017](#B165)).\n\nOther selective inhibitors were developed to inhibit the proteasome machinery for the treatment of hematological malignancies, especially for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Among these inhibitors, Bortezomib (Velcade®) and Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) are used in clinical practice; thanks to the inhibition of proteasome they prevent the degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thus favoring the apoptotic death of cancer cells (Manasanch and Orlowski, [2017](#B170); Goldschmidt et al., [2018](#B101)).\n\nAll these targeted therapeutic agents are currently used for the treatment of tumors, often in combination with other standard chemotherapeutic agents or in combination with monoclonal antibodies and/or other selective inhibitors (Vanneman and Dranoff, [2012](#B256)). The availability of more drugs directed to different molecular targets has stimulated the development of different therapeutic strategies to make treatments more effective and to overcome possible innate or acquired pharmacological resistance (Mokhtari et al., [2017](#B181)).\n\n## Immune checkpoint inhibitors as a new strategy for cancer treatment\n\nCancer immunotherapy has experienced remarkable advances in recent years. After 2010, new monoclonal antibodies directed toward tumor antigens or T-cell protein receptors that downregulate the immune response have been developed (Haanen and Robert, [2015](#B110)). These new drugs are defined immune checkpoint inhibitors and are monoclonal antibodies anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody (anti-PD1), located in the membrane surface of T-cell and cancer cells, respectively (Seidel et al., [2018](#B234)).\n\nThe first approved immune checkpoint inhibitor was Ipilimumab (Yervoy®), in 2011. This is a human IgG1 antibody that binds the membrane protein CTLA-4 expressed in regulatory T cells. The tumor microenvironment is able to induce the overexpression of CTLA-4 that binds the stimulating protein CD80 and CD86 present in the antigen presenting cells preventing their interaction with the T-cell surface receptor, responsible for the activation of immune system against cancer cells (Zitvogel et al., [2013](#B280)).\n\nCurrently, Ipilimumab is used alone or in combination with Nivolumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The first clinical trials reported the improvement of long term-survival in melanoma patients with prolonged PFS and OS (Amdahl et al., [2016](#B6)). Furthermore, several clinical trials are currently underway to establish the therapeutic efficacy of Ipilimumab, alone or in combination with Nivolumab, in other tumors as well as NSCLC, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, etc. (Sakamuri et al., [2018](#B227)).\n\nMore recently, two immune checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies were approved for the treatment of NSCLC, metastatic melanoma, NHL, and urothelial carcinoma as long as these tumors are positive to the presence of PD-L1. These two inhibitors are Nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). Both drugs are human IgG4 anti-PD-1 antibodies directed toward the programmed cell death 1(PD-1) receptor of lymphocytes. This receptor, when linked to the PD-L1 antigens expressed from some tumors, is a down-regulator of T-cells, which become unable to recognize and kill cancer cells.\n\nNSCLC patients treated with Nivolumab showed a lower risk of death and higher median PFS and OS compared to NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel (3-years PFS rate of 10% compared to <1%; 3-years OS rate 17 vs. 8% in patients treated with docetaxel; Vokes et al., [2018](#B262)). These encouraging results are also confirmed by other clinical trials (Ramos-Esquivel et al., [2017](#B211)).\n\nPembrolizumab has also shown therapeutic effects in patients with metastatic tumors, with limited side effects. Pembrolizumab is comparable to Nivolumab, suggesting a possible use of these two drugs as a first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic tumors (Brahmer et al., [2017](#B28); Fessas et al., [2017](#B84); Frenel et al., [2017](#B90)).\n\nDurvalumab (Imfinzi®), a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody, blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 receptors. Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (Faiena et al., [2018](#B76)). Several studies are also evaluating its use for the treatment of patients with NSCLC (Antonia et al., [2017](#B10)).\n\nFinally, the immune checkpoint inhibitors are often administered in combination with each other or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, in order to make the treatment as effective as possible and to prolong the PFS and OS of the patients. The combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors has shown a more durable response compared to monotherapy (Mahoney et al., [2015](#B168)). The use of these drugs has revolutionized the treatment of incurable tumors, such as metastatic melanoma and NSCLC, increasing the life expectancy of patients and counteracting the onset of new metastases.\n\n## The role of molecular radiotherapy in cancer\n\nMolecular radiotherapy (MRT), called also unsealed source radiotherapy or unsealed source radionuclide therapy, is a well-known therapeutic approach used in clinical practice since many decades, based on the use of radioactive compounds (radiopharmaceuticals). Generally, radiopharmaceuticals are administered by ingestion or injection and their action is expressed toward the target cells recognized by specific carrier or depends on the radioisotope properties. The first report of the use of radiopharmaceuticals dates back to 1942 when Hertz used iodine-131 as a treatment for the autoimmune Basedow-Graves disease (Hertz et al., [1942](#B123)). Nowadays, MRT is used for the treatment of both cancer and benign diseases by using simple radioactive compounds (e.g., sodium iodide) or recombinant antibodies labeled with radionuclides, specific for certain cells and tissues (Volkert and Hoffman, [1999](#B263); Buscombe and Navalkissoor, [2012](#B38)).\n\nMRT could also be considered a type of targeted therapy for the treatment of specific areas through the biological and radiopharmaceutical properties of the radiation treatment (Jadvar, [2017](#B133)). In particular, the administration of 131I-Sodium Iodide for the treatment of thyroid cancers and 89Sr-Strontium chloride and 32P-Sodium phosphate for the treatment of bone metastasis are well-recognized treatments used since 1978 (Kutzner et al., [1978](#B155)). In contrast to external beam radiotherapy, the use of systemic radiopharmaceuticals specifically localizes primitive and metastasized cancer cells, widely disseminated in the whole body, with minimal radiation-related damage to normal tissues (Choi, [2018](#B50)). Since the 1980s, several radiopharmaceuticals were developed for treatment of cancers. These drugs were used alone or in combination with molecular carriers for enhancing their specificity toward cancer cells (Wilbur et al., [1996](#B269); Zhu et al., [1998](#B279)). Thanks to the technological advances in the fields of molecular biology, genetic engineering and chemistry it was possible to realize several conjugated drugs widely used in clinical practice. Among these, Iodine-131, MIBG (131I-MIBG metaiodobenzylguanidine), Radium-223 chloride, Strontium-89 chloride, Samarium-153 EDTMP, Phosphorus-32, Yttrium-90, and Yttrium-90 spheres were the most used drugs for both therapeutic and palliative purposes (Guerra Liberal et al., [2014](#B108); Jadvar, [2017](#B133)).\n\nIodine-131 represents the first and most common radiopharmaceutical agents used for the treatment of thyroid cancers (Chung et al., [2010](#B51)). It is composed by sodium iodide with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Its mechanism of action is based on the great affinity and uptake of iodide ion for the thyroid gland. This treatment is not only used for thyroid cancer pathologies but also for benign disease where the radiation emitted by radioiodine can have a beneficial effect (Silberstein et al., [2012](#B238)). The beta radiations produced by sodium iodide determine damages to both normal and cancer thyroid cells inducing the cell deaths and thus having a therapeutic effect (Spitzweg et al., [2001](#B243)).\n\nOther unsealed radioactive sources are used as palliative treatments for the management of bone metastasis. Among these radioactive sources, Radium-223 chloride, Strontium-89 chloride, and Samarium-153 EDTMP are used for secondary bone metastatic disseminations of different cancer histotypes (Janjan, [1997](#B135); Choi, [2018](#B50)). In particular, Strontium and Radium radioisotopes are taken up by bone as they mimic calcium ion, while samarium thanks to its covalent bond to tetraphosphate EDTMP is actively absorbed by osteoblasts, involved in the bone repair near the bone metastasis lesions (Wissing et al., [2013](#B271); Anderson et al., [2014](#B8)). In these ways, Radium-223 chloride, Strontium-89 chloride, and Samarium-153 EDTMP can effectively counteract the progression of bone metastases, reduce patient suffering and prolong life expectancy.\n\nFinally, other radiopharmaceuticals are used for the treatment of cancer, including Phosphorus-32, Yttrium-90 spheres for the treatment of colorectal liver metastasis, 131I-MIBG meta-iodo-benzylguanidine for the treatment of phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, and Yttrium-90 and Lutetium-177 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (Forrer et al., [2005](#B88); Sudbrock et al., [2010](#B247); Hadaki et al., [2011](#B111); Cheng et al., [2015](#B49)).\n\n## New frontiers in the treatment of cancer\n\nThe drugs discovery in oncology is a constantly evolving field and every year several new approaches are proposed. As discussed above, after the Second World War there has been a rapid growth in the number of drugs available thanks to the important discoveries obtained in the biological, genetic and molecular fields. Parallel to the increase in the number of available drugs, there was also an increase in the effectiveness of the treatments, which consequently led to a significant improvement in the survival and quality of life of the patients.\n\nMany clinical trials are currently underway to develop new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hematological tumors and solid tumors. In particular, important results were obtained in the field of cell therapy, with the implementation of the so-called CAR-T cell therapy (Chimeric-Antigen Receptor) which led to the recent approval of two treatments, axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta®) and tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®), used respectively for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Grupp, [2018](#B107)).\n\nCAR-T cell therapy consists in the ligation of engineered receptors to immune T cell specific for antigens expressed by the cancer cells, therefore the resulting chimeric T cell harbor a kind of monoclonal antibody with high specificity only toward cancer cells. In particular, the chimeric receptor is added to the immune cells by inserting a genic construct into the T cell DNA. The adjective “chimeric” means that the artificial receptors are constituted with protein structure derived from different DNA organisms and sources (Xu et al., [2018](#B274)).\n\nThe realization of CAR-T cell therapy involves the removal of T-cells from the patient and their *in vitro* genetic modification for the addition of the chimeric receptor; subsequently, the engineered T-cells are reinfused into the patient, where they selectively interact with cancer cells, inducing immune-mediated cell death without affecting normal cells (Srivastava and Riddell, [2015](#B244)). Potentially, CAR-T therapy can be implemented for all tumor types, a fundamental step for this possibility is to recognize specific antigens expressed by different tumors.\n\nThe first successful CAR-T therapy was developed against malignant B-cell responsible for a plethora of hematological tumors including acute ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and many different forms of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-cel) therapy consist of chimeric T cells receptors against CD19, a surface molecule expressed in B-cells after their differentiation. Therefore, Axi-cel is effective for both normal and malignant B-cells determining their cell death, however, the B-cell precursor does not present CD19 antigen and for this reason is not affected by the treatment allowing the reconstitution of normal B-cells after treatment (Lee et al., [2015](#B158)).\n\nIn 2010, Kochenderfer treated the first patient with an anti-CD19 CAR T therapy and obtained a significant clinical response (Kochenderfer et al., [2010](#B149)). Subsequently, several clinical trials were performed to assess the efficacy and safety of anti-CD19 CAR-T. The most important clinical trial is the ZUMA-1 conducted on 22 patients with aggressive B cell lymphomas that showed an overall response rate in 73% of patients and a complete response in 55% (Kochenderfer et al., [2017](#B148)). These results were confirmed by the phase II ZUMA-1 trials that demonstrated an overall response rate and a complete response in 82 and 54% of 101 total patients, respectively. However, some of these patients experienced acute toxicities and some of them died during the treatment (Neelapu et al., [2017](#B192)).\n\nThe other currently approved CAR-T therapy for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the one using tisagenlecleucel. Similar to Axi-cel therapy, tisagenlecleucel also relies on artificial T cells with a chimeric anti-CD19 antigen. This therapy was developed by Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania and is a personalized treatment for the patient that is obtained with a 22-days experimental procedure. Via viral vectors, the patient's T cells are modified by adding a chimeric gene coding for the specific CAR receptor for leukemic cells (Porter et al., [2011](#B206)).\n\nThe clinical trials showed that CLL and ALL patients treated with Kymriah had a promising and durable antitumor efficacy with an 82% overall response rate and a complete response in 68% of patients (Mueller et al., [2017](#B186)). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel is also associated with a series of adverse effects, among which the most important are the cytokine release syndrome and neurological events that require treatment in specialized centers (Badieyan and Hoseini, [2018](#B16)). Many studies are trying to apply CAR-T therapy to solid tumors using modified heterologous cells obtained in cell factories.\n\nRecently, many researchers are trying to develop new therapeutic approaches, based on genomic editing using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to correct genetic aberrations responsible for neoplastic transformation (Zhan et al., [2018](#B277)).\n\nFinally, in recent years, many research centers are developing therapeutic anticancer vaccines designed according to the individual characteristics of the tumor to make the immune system more active against the cancer cells and determine their death. However, the realization of these vaccines is complex due to the variability that characterizes each tumor. Already in 2008, the Oncophage vaccine was approved for the treatment of glioma, renal cancer, and metastatic melanoma; this vaccine consists of the heat shock protein 96 extracted directly from the tumor tissue and is supposed to stimulate the immune response against neoplastic cells of the same tumor (di Pietro et al., [2008](#B64)). Subsequently, in 2010, another vaccine was approved, sipuleucel-T, for the treatment of metastatic, hormone-refractory, prostate cancer. This vaccine is again produced for each individual patient and consists of pulsed patient's dendritic cells with recombinant prostatic acid phosphatase expressed in the 95% of prostate cancer cells. In this way, the administration of the vaccine induces an increase in the immune response directed only to the tumor cells, determining their elimination (So-Rosillo and Small, [2006](#B242)). Many other anticancer therapeutic vaccines are under study, but production difficulties make this approach particularly expensive and not suitable for all patients.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that cancer drug treatments are constantly evolving. From the Second Post-War to the advent of the new millennium, there has been an increase in the number of drugs and therapies available for the treatment of all hematological and solid tumors that have contributed to the significant reduction in cancer mortality rates. Furthermore, thanks to the primary and secondary prevention campaigns the reduction of incidence rates was recorded for many tumors, particularly for those of predominantly environmental etiology (Figure [1](#F1)).\n\nIn the next few years, the development and approval of new highly innovative chemical, biological and biotechnological drugs are expected. These new treatments will start a new revolution in the field of clinical oncology, mainly based on a specific individual approach for each patient, a new personalized and more effective medicine.\n\n## Author contributions\n\nLF and SS wrote the manuscript and were involved in data collection.

TNBC is an aggressive type of breast cancer with an increased risk for disease recurrence. KEYNOTE-522 showed that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) before surgery and continued as a single agent after surgery significantly prolonged event-free survival (EFS) versus the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens alone in patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III TNBC – there was a 37% reduction in the risk of disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, a local/distant recurrence, a second primary cancer, or death from any cause (HR=0.63 [95% CI, 0.48-0.82]; p=0.00031). With this approval, KEYTRUDA is now approved in the U.S. for 30 indications.\n\n“Even when TNBC is diagnosed early, 30-40% of patients will suffer cancer recurrence after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery,” said Dr. Joyce O’Shaughnessy, chair of Breast Cancer Research, Baylor University Medical Center, Texas Oncology, U.S. Oncology, Dallas, Texas. “Therefore, there is a high unmet need for new treatment options. Today’s approval is very welcome news and has the potential to change the treatment paradigm by now including an immunotherapy as part of the regimen for patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC.”\n\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.\n\n“Triple-negative is a difficult-to-treat type of breast cancer that unfortunately is more common in the U.S. in younger women and in Black women,” said Dr. Vicki Goodman, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are proud to offer a new treatment option for patients faced with this challenging cancer. This neoadjuvant and adjuvant combination with KEYTRUDA is the first immunotherapy regimen to be approved in high-risk early-stage TNBC, marking a meaningful milestone for the breast cancer community.”\n\nAdditionally, the FDA converted the accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) as determined by an FDA-approved test to a full (regular) approval based on confirmatory data from KEYNOTE-522. This approval was originally granted in November 2020 based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 trial.\n\nMerck is rapidly advancing a broad portfolio in gynecologic and breast cancers with an extensive clinical development program for KEYTRUDA and several other investigational and approved medicines across these areas.\n\n**Data Supporting the Approval**\n\nThe approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-522 ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov), [NCT03036488](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03036488&esheet=52466473&newsitemid=20210727005394&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03036488&index=1&md5=4ca902f20b22434a87fc8402e6b12a55)), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 1,174 patients with newly diagnosed previously untreated high-risk early-stage TNBC (tumor size >1 centimeter [cm] but ≤2 cm in diameter with nodal involvement or tumor size >2 cm in diameter regardless of nodal involvement). Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD‑L1) expression. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by nodal status (positive vs. negative), tumor size (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) and choice of carboplatin (dosed every three weeks vs. weekly). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following two treatment arms; all study mediations were administered intravenously:\n\nThe main efficacy outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR) rate and EFS. Pathological complete response rate was defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and was assessed by the blinded local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. Event-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, secondary primary malignancy, or death due to any cause. An additional efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS).\n\nThe study population characteristics were: median age of 49 years (range, 22 to 80), 11% age 65 or older; 99.9% female; 64% White, 20% Asian, 4.5% Black, and 1.8% American Indian or Alaska Native; 87% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0, and 13% ECOG PS of 1; 56% were pre-menopausal, and 44% were post-menopausal; 7% were primary Tumor 1 (T1), 68% T2, 19% T3, and 7% T4; 49% were nodal involvement 0 (N0), 40% N1, 11% N2, and 0.2% N3; 75% of patients were overall stage II, and 25% were stage III.\n\nEfficacy results showed:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Endpoint** | **KEYTRUDA With  Chemotherapy/KEYTRUDA**  **n=784** | **Placebo With  Chemotherapy/Placebo**  **n=390** |\n| **pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0)** \\* |  |  |\n| Number of patients with pCR | 494 | 217 |\n| pCR rate (%), (95% CI) | 63.0 (59.5, 66.4) | 55.6 (50.6, 60.6) |\n| Treatment difference (%) estimate (95% CI)†‡ | 7.5 (1.6, 13.4) | |\n| **EFS** |  |  |\n| Number of patients with event (%) | 123 (16%) | 93 (24%) |\n| Hazard ratio (95% CI)§ | 0.63 (0.48, 0.82) | |\n| p-Value ¶,# | 0.00031 | |\n| \\* Based on entire intent-to-treat population (n=1,174 patients)  † Based on a pre-specified pCR interim analysis in n=602 patients, the pCR rate difference was statistically significant (p=0.00055 compared to a significance level of 0.003).  ‡ Based on Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by nodal status, tumor size, and choice of carboplatin  § Based on stratified Cox regression model  ¶ Based on a pre-specified EFS interim analysis (compared to a significance level of 0.0052)  # Based on log-rank test stratified by nodal status, tumor size, and choice of carboplatin | | |\n\n**Endpoint**\n\n**KEYTRUDA With\n  \nChemotherapy/KEYTRUDA**\n\n**n=784**\n\n**Placebo With\n  \nChemotherapy/Placebo**\n\n**n=390**\n\n**pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0)**\n\\*\n\nNumber of patients with pCR\n\n494\n\n217\n\npCR rate (%), (95% CI)\n\n63.0 (59.5, 66.4)\n\n55.6 (50.6, 60.6)\n\nTreatment difference (%) estimate (95% CI)†‡\n\n7.5 (1.6, 13.4)\n\n**EFS**\n\nNumber of patients with event (%)\n\n123 (16%)\n\n93 (24%)\n\nHazard ratio (95% CI)§\n\n0.63 (0.48, 0.82)\n\np-Value ¶,#\n\n0.00031\n\n\\* Based on entire intent-to-treat population (n=1,174 patients)\n\n† Based on a pre-specified pCR interim analysis in n=602 patients, the pCR rate difference was statistically significant (p=0.00055 compared to a significance level of 0.003).\n\n‡ Based on Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by nodal status, tumor size, and choice of carboplatin\n\n§ Based on stratified Cox regression model\n\n¶ Based on a pre-specified EFS interim analysis (compared to a significance level of 0.0052)\n\n# Based on log-rank test stratified by nodal status, tumor size, and choice of carboplatin\n\nAt the protocol’s pre-specified interim analysis of OS (interim analysis four), OS data were not mature, with 45% of the required events for the final analysis.\n\nIn the study, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 13.3 months (range, 1 day to 21.9 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including one each of adrenal crisis, autoimmune encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis in association with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received KEYTRUDA included febrile neutropenia (15%), pyrexia (3.7%), anemia (2.6%), and neutropenia (2.2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (2.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (1.5%), and rash (1%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 57% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were neutropenia (26%), thrombocytopenia and increased ALT (6% each), increased AST (3.7%), anemia (3.5%), rash (3.2%), febrile neutropenia and leukopenia (2.8% each), upper respiratory tract infection (2.6%), pyrexia (2.2%), and fatigue (2.1%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades ≥20%) were fatigue (70%), nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), rash (52%), constipation (42%), diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy (41% each), stomatitis (34%), vomiting (31%), headache (30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), cough (26%), abdominal pain (24%), decreased appetite (23%), insomnia (21%), and myalgia (20%).\n\n**About Triple-Negative Breast Cancer**\n\nTriple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that characteristically has a high recurrence rate within the first five years after diagnosis. While some people with breast cancer may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), people with TNBC test negative for all three. Approximately 10-15% of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed with TNBC. TNBC tends to be more common in people who are younger than 40 years of age, who are African American, or who have a *BRCA*1 mutation.\n\n**About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg**\n\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\n\nMerck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,500 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\n\n**Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.**\n\n*Melanoma*\n\nKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nKEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph node(s) following complete resection.\n\n*Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer*\n\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.\n\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:\n\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.\n\nPneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.\n\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\n\n*KEYTRUDA*\n*as a Single Agent*\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.\n\n*KEYTRUDA with Axitinib*\n\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\n*Adrenal Insufficiency*\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism.\n\n*Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis*\n\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes.

Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; *Gastrointestinal:* Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; *Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:* Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; *Endocrine:* Hypoparathyroidism; *Hematologic/Immune:* Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.\n\n**Infusion-Related Reactions**\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.\n\n**Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)**\n\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\n**Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma**\n\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\n\n**Embryofetal Toxicity**\n\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea (56%), fatigue/asthenia (52%), hypertension (48%), hepatotoxicity (39%), hypothyroidism (35%), decreased appetite (30%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (28%), nausea (28%), stomatitis/mucosal inflammation (27%), dysphonia (25%), rash (25%), cough (21%), and constipation (21%).\n\nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with TMB-H cancer were similar to those occurring in patients with other solid tumors who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent.\n\nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC or locally advanced cSCC were similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-522, when KEYTRUDA was administered with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent (n=778) to patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, high-risk early-stage TNBC, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients, including 1 each of adrenal crisis, autoimmune encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis in association with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; those ≥2% were febrile neutropenia (15%), pyrexia (3.7%), anemia (2.6%), and neutropenia (2.2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 20% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions (≥1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation were increased ALT (2.7%), increased AST (1.5%), and rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA were fatigue (70%), nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), rash (52%), constipation (42%), diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy (41% each), stomatitis (34%), vomiting (31%), headache (30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), cough (26%), abdominal pain (24%), decreased appetite (23%), insomnia (21%), and myalgia (20%).\n\nIn KEYNOTE-355, when KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (paclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or gemcitabine and carboplatin) were administered to patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (n=596), fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.5% of patients, including cardio-respiratory arrest (0.7%) and septic shock (0.3%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy; the serious reactions in ≥2% were pneumonia (2.9%), anemia (2.2%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 11% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation (≥1%) were increased ALT (2.2%), increased AST (1.5%), and pneumonitis (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy were fatigue (48%), nausea (44%), alopecia (34%), diarrhea and constipation (28% each), vomiting and rash (26% each), cough (23%), decreased appetite (21%), and headache (20%).\n\n**Lactation**\n\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose.\n\n**Pediatric Use**\n\nIn KEYNOTE-051, 161 pediatric patients (62 pediatric patients aged 6 months to younger than 12 years and 99 pediatric patients aged 12 years to 17 years) were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 24 months).\n\nAdverse reactions that occurred at a ≥10% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to adults were pyrexia (33%), vomiting (30%), leukopenia (30%), upper respiratory tract infection (29%), neutropenia (26%), headache (25%), and Grade 3 anemia (17%).\n\n**About the Merck Access Program for KEYTRUDA**\n\nAt Merck, we are committed to supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines.

The objective response rate was 13% for phase 2 patients and 19% overall, with median progression-free survival of 8.1 months and median overall survival of 27.6 months.\n\n### Meaning\n\nDoxorubicin in combination with pembrolizumab is a promising combination worthy of further study, especially in certain sarcoma subtypes, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Importance\n\nAnthracycline-based therapy is standard first-line treatment for most patients with advanced and metastatic sarcomas. Although multiple trials have attempted to show improved outcomes in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma over doxorubicin monotherapy, each has fallen short of demonstrating improved outcomes.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of doxorubicin in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, anthracycline-naive sarcomas.\n\n### Design, Setting, and Participants\n\nThis nonrandomized clinical trial used a 2-stage phase 2 design and was performed at a single, academic sarcoma specialty center. Patients were adults with good performance status and end-organ function. Patients with all sarcoma subtypes were allowed to enroll with the exception of osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\n### Interventions\n\nTwo dose levels of doxorubicin (45 and 75 mg/m2) were tested for safety in combination with pembrolizumab.\n\n### Main Outcomes and Measures\n\nObjective response rate (ORR) was the primary end point. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were secondary end points. Correlative studies included immunohistochemistry, gene expression, and serum cytokines.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 37 patients (22 men; 15 women) were treated in the combined phase 1/2 trial. The median (range) patient age was 58.4 (25-80) years. The most common histologic subtype was leiomyosarcoma (11 patients). Doxorubicin plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated without significant unexpected toxic effects. The ORR was 13% for phase 2 patients and 19% overall. Median PFS was 8.1 (95% CI, 7.6-10.8) months. Median OS was 27.6 (95% CI, 18.7-not reached) months at the time of this analysis. Two of 3 patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and 2 of 4 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma had durable partial responses. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were present in 21% of evaluable tumors and associated with inferior PFS (log-rank *P* = .03). No dose-limiting toxic effects were observed.\n\n### Conclusions and Relevance\n\nIn this nonrandomized clinical trial, doxorubicin plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated. Although the primary end point for ORR was not reached, the PFS and OS observed compared favorably with prior published studies. Further studies are warranted, especially those focusing on undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\n### Trial Registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT02888665](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02888665)\n\n## Introduction\n\nPatients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) generally receive first-line therapy with doxorubicin alone or with ifosfamide.[1](#cbr200012r1) Median overall survival (OS) for doxorubicin alone ranges from 12.8 to 20.4 months, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.1 to 6.8 months and objective response rates (ORRs) of 12% to 20%.[1](#cbr200012r1),[2](#cbr200012r2),[3](#cbr200012r3),[4](#cbr200012r4),[5](#cbr200012r5) Multiple trials combining doxorubicin with investigational agents have failed to show improved outcomes.[1](#cbr200012r1),[2](#cbr200012r2),[3](#cbr200012r3),[4](#cbr200012r4),[5](#cbr200012r5),[6](#cbr200012r6)\n\nProgrammed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is variably expressed by STS, especially undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPSs).[7](#cbr200012r7),[8](#cbr200012r8) Responses to pembrolizumab monotherapy have been seen in STS, particularly UPS,[9](#cbr200012r9) and some, though not all,[10](#cbr200012r10) combination therapies may be associated with improved programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade.[11](#cbr200012r11),[12](#cbr200012r12),[13](#cbr200012r13) Chemotherapy may synergize with immunotherapy by depleting suppressive immune cells, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns and increasing tumor antigen presentation through tumor toxicity.[14](#cbr200012r14) We conducted a phase 1/2 trial to assess the tolerability and outcomes of treatment with pembrolizumab in combination with doxorubicin.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients, Treatment Schedules, and Supportive Care\n\nAll research herein was reviewed and approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The trial protocol can be found in [Supplement 1](#note-CBR200012-1-s). Race and ethnicity data were self-reported and collected for institutional reporting requirements.\n\nPathology was confirmed at the University of Washington. Adult patients with sarcoma with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate organ function were eligible. Patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma were ineligible because well-established alternative regimens exist (eFigure 1 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)).\n\nPatients’ initial cycle was pembrolizumab (200 mg administered intravenously) alone. Cycles were 21 days. Starting with cycle 2, doxorubicin was given prior to pembrolizumab, same day, every 3 weeks, for up to 6 cycles. After cycle 7, pembrolizumab treatment continued for up to 2 years (see eFigure 2A in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). Growth factors were not permitted until cycle 3 during phase 1. Imaging, performed every 12 weeks, was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 with the option of confirming progressive disease (PD) in clinically well patients.\n\n### Trial Design, Statistical Basis, and End Points\n\nTwo doses of doxorubicin (45 and 75 mg/m2) were evaluated with pembrolizumab using a 3 + 3 design. A dose-limiting toxic effect was defined as any possibly related, unexpected, grade 3 or greater serious adverse events, or any possibly related adverse event requiring discontinuation of either drug during the first 6 weeks of combination treatment (eFigure 2B in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)).\n\nThe primary end point of the phase 2 portion of the study was the ORR as assessed by RECIST 1.1.[15](#cbr200012r15) The 2-stage study was designed to rule out ORR of 15% or less with 85% power if the true ORR was 35%, using a 1-sided 5% level test. If 2 or more responses were observed in the 20-patient first stage, an additional 15 patients would accrue. If 10 or more responses of 35 patients (29%) were observed, this would rule out a 15% ORR. Although the primary end points were evaluated for the phase 1 and 2 cohorts separately, data were combined in other analyses. Data were analyzed as of September 2019.\n\nThe OS was calculated as the duration from the start of treatment to death due to any cause, and PFS as the duration from start to progression or death. Outcomes were censored at the date of last contact for living patients (OS) or living and progression free (PFS). For these secondary end points, 2-sided *P* values less than .05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute); Excel, version 16.33 (Microsoft Corp); and Prism, version 8.4 (GraphPad Software) (see eFigure 3 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s) for detailed methods regarding correlative analyses).\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient Demographic Characteristics\n\nIn the combined phase 1/2 trial, 37 patients (22 men; 15 women) were treated, including 6 phase 1 patients—3 patients at each dose. Both phase 2 stages enrolled, but accrual was closed at 31 of 35 planned patients because of an insufficient number of second-stage partial responses (PRs), indicating that the study would not achieve the primary end point. The most common histology was leiomyosarcoma, present in 11 patients (30%), 3 being uterine leiomyosarcomas. Demographic characteristics, including histology, are summarized in [Table 1](#cbr200012t1).\n\n#### Table 1.

The phase 2 dose was 75 mg/m2. In both phase 1 and 2 cohorts, the most common toxic effects were nausea (n = 32) and fatigue (n = 21) (see [Table 2](#cbr200012t2); eTable 1 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). No grade 5 toxic effects were seen; the only attributable grade 4 toxic effects were neutropenia (n = 6), leukopenia (n = 1), and febrile neutropenia (1), all of which resolved. Two patients had grade 3 reductions in ejection fraction attributable to doxorubicin. Notable pembrolizumab-related toxic effects included grade 3 adrenal insufficiency (n = 1) and hypothyroidism (n = 7).\n\n#### Table 2.

Two patients had unconfirmed PRs, and 11 patients had stable disease with tumor regression as their best response ([Figure](#cbr200012f1), B). One patient came off study for increasing symptoms prior to follow-up imaging. Two of 3 patients with UPS, and 2 of 4 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma had durable PRs (eFigure 4 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). Three patients with chondrosarcoma had tumor regression, including 1 conventional chondrosarcoma with a 26% decrease in size.\n\n#### Figure. Patient Responses.\n\n![Figure. ](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8dbe/7489365/2ddd6bd8d69f/jamaoncol-e203689-g001.jpg)\n\n![Figure. ](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8dbe/7489365/2ddd6bd8d69f/jamaoncol-e203689-g001.jpg)\n\nA, Waterfall plot demonstrating the percentage change in tumor size from baseline constituting the best response for each patient. B, Spider plots showing responses for all patients.\n\n### Survival Outcomes\n\nMedian PFS was 8.1 (95% CI, 7.6-10.8) months, with 29 of 37 patients (78.4%) having had an event and 4 patients with continuing stable disease or PR at the time of this analysis. The PFS rates at 12 and 24 weeks were 81% (95% CI, 64%-90%) and 73% (95% CI, 56%-84%), respectively. At 12 months, the PFS was 27% (95% CI, 14%-42%). Median OS was 27.6 (95% CI, 18.7-not reached) months at the time of this analysis.\n\n### Correlative Studies\n\nImmunohistochemistry was evaluable for 29 patients; 66% had PD-L1 expression scores of 0, reflecting a low level of PD-L1 expression (eTable 2 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). Expression of PD-L1 was not associated with PFS or OS. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were present in 21% of evaluable tumors and associated with inferior PFS (log-rank *P* = .03) (eFigure 5 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). This was confirmed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis that adjusted for age, sex, and number of prior therapies (*P* = .04; eTable 3 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). Nanostring data were available for 24 patients (eTable 4 in [Supplement 2](#note-CBR200012-1-s)). No gene was significantly associated with PFS after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nSerum cytokine levels were assessed before treatment and during cycles 1 and 2. Granulocyte macrophage–colony-stimulating factor levels increased each cycle, and IL-15 levels dropped following doxorubicin treatment. Circulating IL-2R, IP10, and CD30 levels rose sharply after cycle 1, while levels of IL-8 dropped.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis nonrandomized phase 1/2 trial demonstrated that doxorubicin plus pembrolizumab can be given safely and may be associated with clinical benefit for patients with advanced sarcoma. While the combined ORR observed here is similar to prior published series, the PFS and OS seen here are encouraging.[2](#cbr200012r2),[3](#cbr200012r3),[4](#cbr200012r4),[6](#cbr200012r6) In correlative studies, we found that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with inferior PFS. This may reflect more aggressive tumor biology rather than as association with the PD-1 inhibitor.\n\n### Limitations\n\nSimilar to other sarcoma trials, histologic subtypes likely influenced these results. Our trial, like others, demonstrated a higher response rate and clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in UPS compared with other sarcoma subtypes,[11](#cbr200012r11) despite their generally worse prognosis.[5](#cbr200012r5) Durable PRs were also seen in 2 of 4 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are generally resistant to doxorubicin; inclusion of these patients in the study likely lowered the ORR. Still, 2 patients with chondrosarcoma had durable disease regression, suggesting that doxorubicin/pembrolizumab may benefit these patients. For patients with these selected subtypes, follow-up studies are warranted.\n\nTrial Protocol\n\n**eFigure 1.** Eligibility\n\n**eFigure 2.** Study Schema\n\n**eFigure 3.** Methods for Correlative Studies\n\n**eFigure 4.** Durability of Treatment Responses\n\n**eFigure 5.** PFS Is Inversely Associated With the Presence of TIL\n\n**eTable 1.** Complete AEs\n\n**eTable 2.** IHC\n\n**eTable 3.** Multivariate Cox Regression Including Age, Sex, Number of Prior Lines of Therapy as well as TIL\n\n**eTable 4.** Top 10 Genes Associated With ORR, PFS and OS.\n\n## References\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\nTrial Protocol\n\n**eFigure 1.** Eligibility\n\n**eFigure 2.** Study Schema\n\n**eFigure 3.** Methods for Correlative Studies\n\n**eFigure 4.** Durability of Treatment Responses\n\n**eFigure 5.** PFS Is Inversely Associated With the Presence of TIL\n\n**eTable 1.** Complete AEs\n\n**eTable 2.** IHC\n\n**eTable 3.** Multivariate Cox Regression Including Age, Sex, Number of Prior Lines of Therapy as well as TIL\n\n**eTable 4.** Top 10 Genes Associated With ORR, PFS and OS.\n\nArticles from JAMA Oncology are provided here courtesy of **American Medical Association**\n\n![Close](/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg)\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n## PERMALINK\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n### Similar articles\n\n### Cited by other articles\n\n### Links to NCBI Databases\n\n## Cite\n\n## Add to Collections\n\nConnect with NLM\n\n[National Library of Medicine\n  \n 8600 Rockville Pike](https://www.google.com/maps/place/8600+Rockville+Pike,+Bethesda,+MD+20894/%4038.9959508,\n            -77.101021,17z/data%3D!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c95e25765ddb%3A0x19156f88b27635b8!8m2!3d38.9959508!\n            4d-77.0988323)"
