CARs are recombinant receptors for antigen that engage cell surface molecules through the variable region of an antibody and signal through arrayed T cell activating and costimulatory domains. CARs allow redirection of T cell cytotoxicity against any antigen of choice, independent of MHC expression. Patient T cells engineered to express CARs specific for CD19 have yielded remarkable outcomes in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies, setting off unprecedented interest in T cell engineering and cell-based cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we present the challenges to extend the use of CAR T cells to solid tumors and other pathologies. We further highlight progress in CAR design, cell manufacturing and genome editing, which in aggregate hold the promise of generating safer and more effective genetically instructed immunity. Novel engineered cell types, including innate T cell types, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived immune cells, are on the horizon, as are applications of CAR T cells to treat autoimmunity, severe infections and senescence-associated pathologies.\n\n**Keywords:** Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, CD19, genome editing, immunotherapy, tumor immunology\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Introduction\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptors (CD19 CARs) have opened a path for novel immune therapies in oncology and other fields of medicine. This therapeutic innovation is predicated on advances in genetic engineering, tumor immunology and cell manufacturing sciences [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R1)–[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R4)]. Its foundational principles consist in genetically instructing T cells to recognize any chosen antigen, thus by-passing the restrictions of repertoire limitation and immune tolerance, and accelerating the establishment of immunity by providing potent manufactured immune cells to the patient, rather than inducing an uncertain endogenous response through active immunization. By using synthetic receptors for antigen that directly engage cell surface molecules, in contrast to the physiological T cell receptor (TCR), T cells can circumvent HLA restriction and the limitations of antigen processing [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R6)]. These principles, validated by targeting CD19 in B cell malignancies and T cell manufacturing implemented in the academic setting, have established CD19 CAR therapy as a prototype for synthetic immunity and a paradigm-shifting form of personalized medicine.\n\nCARs are synthetic receptors that may engage proteins, carbohydrates or glycolipids independently of antigen processing and HLA expression. Similar to the natural TCR/CD3 complex, CARs require an activating domain to couple antigen recognition to the initiation of T cell activation and cytolysis [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R7)]. However, studies enabled by retroviral-mediated T cell engineering [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R8)] demonstrated that the CD3-ζ chain activation domain is not sufficient to sustain T cell function in primary T cells [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R9)]. Engineered costimulation [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R10)] eventually provided a solution when it was integrated into a single dual-signaling receptor that enabled T cells to not only kill their targets but expand upon repeated exposure to antigen [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R11)]. The path to “living drugs” was opened. We eventually renamed CD3-ζ chain fusions as first generation CARs and dual-signaling receptors as second generation CARs [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R12)]. Second generation CARs are the backbone of present day CAR therapies.\n\nCD19 is a cell-surface molecule that is found in most B cell malignancies, which we initially chose as a CAR target over other B cell surface molecules such as CD20 and CD22 because of its relatively higher expression [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R14)]. Building on the demonstration that CD19-specific CARs could eliminate established leukemia and lymphoma in mice [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R14)], Memorial Sloan Kettering, the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania undertook clinical trials in patients with refractory/relapsed CD19+ malignancies. Early anecdotal results obtained in NHL [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R15)], CLL [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R16)] and ALL [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R17), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R18)] were soon confirmed in larger single- and multi-center studies [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R19)–[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R22)]. The first CARs to be approved by the FDA in 2017 and the EMA in 2018, were second generation CARs specific for CD19 [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R4)]. Those CAR molecules encompass either a CD28 [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R12)] or 4-1BB [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R23)] costimulatory domain ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)). Four CAR products are approved to date (Tisagenlecleucel, Axicabtagene ciloleucel, Brexucabtagene autoleucel, Lisocabtagene maraleucel), for relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young-adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and certain follicular lymphomas. Several excellent clinical reviews addressing the efficacy of CD19 CAR T cells in different disease settings as well as their toxicity, which include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are available [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R24)–[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R29)].\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Image 9: Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/e0343570864e/nihms-1828968-f0001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/figure/F1/)\n\nCAR structure, function and design.

Right: Altering the length of extracellular and intracellular domains in a 4-1BB-based CAR (BBz(86) CAR) reduced cytokine secretion and CRS severity [[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R44)]. Panel A has been partially published in [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R37)].\n\nThe success of CD19 CAR therapy has spawned broad interest in this novel approach to immunotherapy. There are presently over 700 clinical trials listed at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), 41% of which target CD19 and the rest either hematological malignancies (32%) or solid tumors (27%) ([Figure 2A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F2)). CD22 and CD20 have proven to be effective CAR targets in B cell malignancies, albeit to a lesser degree than CD19 [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R30), [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R31)], while BCMA shows great promise for the treatment of multiple myeloma, with BCMA CAR T cells under consideration for approval by the FDA [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R32)–[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R34)]. This review addresses the next frontiers and challenges facing the implementation of CAR therapy in oncology and beyond.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Image 10: Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/c553c1d68d4e/nihms-1828968-f0002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/figure/F2/)\n\nSummary of clinical trials targeting CAR T cells.\n\nA. Clinical trials targeting CD19, other hematologic and solid malignancies. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): 41% of worldwide clinical trials aim at CD19 CAR T cells. This includes dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 CAR T cell treatments. 32% of all clinical trials target hematological cancers but not CD19. 27% of all clinical trials target solid tumors.\n\nB. CAR targeted antigens under clinical investigation for hematologic and solid tumors. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): Analyzing the distribution of antigens of interest used for directing CAR T cells in clinical trials, reveals that anti-CD19 scFv is the leading CAR T used (37%) followed by the anti-BCMA scFv (9%). Other CAR T cells directed to additional hematology or non-hematology antigens are lacking behind with less than 4% out of all CAR T clinical trials.\n\nC. Cell types engineered for CAR therapy. Based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (March 2021): The majority of CAR T cells are transduced using the αβ T cell (>96%). Other cell types are starting to be investigated, accounting for 4% of listed clinical trials. These cells include: γδ T cells, NK, and NK/T cells, pluripotent stem cell-derived immune cells and monocytes.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Evolution of CAR design\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPresent day CARs comprise a single-chain Fv (scFv) for antigen recognition and a dual-signaling tail, typically comprising the CD3-ζ and either CD28 or 4-1BB cytoplasmic domains [[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R35)–[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R38)]. Different scaffolds, adapted to the epitope’s position on the targeted molecule, can further improve overall CAR function [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R39)]. The binding domain is in some cases derived from a receptor-ligand pair or may consist in a VHH element rather than an scFv [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R40)]. This architecture is modular and can be adapted to a wide range of targets ([Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)).\n\nCAR designs are evolving, utilizing affinity-optimized human binding domains and recruiting different signaling pathways (reviewed in [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R37)]). One example of such evolution is the reduction of strength of activation in the potent 28z CAR design [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R41)] and another its augmentation in the less potent BBz [[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R42)] ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)[C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)). Other examples are the additional recruitment of jak/stat signaling in 28z CARs ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)) or adding spacer elements to attenuate cytokine secretion by BBz CARs ([Figure 1C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F1)) [[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R43), [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R44)].\n\nIn contrast to the single specificity of natural T cells, CAR T cells may engage multiple antigens, through the design of multi-specific CARs or CAR co-expression. Targeting two independent antigens may reduce tumor escape and augment selective pressure on the tumor cell. The first dual-targeted CAR T cells have entered the clinic, combining two BBz CARs specific for CD19 and CD22 [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R45)]. Combining a 28z CAR with a BBz CAR provides yet superior antigen sensitivity and potency, which is further enhanced by matching signaling features to antigen density [[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R46)]. A variant approach requires the successful recognition of two upregulated tumor antigens by two different CARs to initiate full immune cell functions, as demonstrated by Eshhar’s group using dual-targeted CAR T cells against myeloma cells. The results not only show efficient and potent CAR T but also a safe strategy sparing normal healthy tissues [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R47)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only CAR T cells to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) at this time are directed to CD19 for the treatment of some refractory leukemias and lymphomas. Adapting CAR therapy to the treatment of solid tumors is a major goal and challenge [[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R48)–[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R51)]. The first results obtained in solid tumor trials, modeled on the successful strategies implemented for B cell malignancies, have been lackluster, pointing to the need to further improve and specifically adapt CAR therapy for solid tumors. Overcoming the mechanisms of resistance to CAR therapy already encountered in the setting of B cell malignancies is likely to help reach this goal.\n\nOne mechanism of resistance is the absence or insufficient level of expression of the CAR target in tumor cells. Reports from multiple trials have shown that up to 25% of patients treated with CD19-targeted CAR T cells relapsed with CD19-negative or CD19-low disease [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R52)] This phenomenon is known as antigen escape. Another mechanism of resistance can be traced to the limited ability of CAR T cells to traffic to and infiltrate the tumor, due to physical barriers and/or an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the realm of B cell malignancies, it has been frequently noted that responses may be complete in bone marrow but not other disease sites such as lymph nodes or the retroperitoneal space [[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R53)]. Even infiltrated, it is to be expected that solid tumors will deploy a range of mechanisms to inhibit T cells and CAR T cells, which involve myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R54)]. The successful tackling of solid tumors by CAR T cells will thus entail, at the least, the Identification of suitable target antigens, enabling CAR T cells access all tumor sites and overcoming the immune suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment.\n\n### Target selection\n\nThe first attempts to tackle solid tumors replicated the approaches established in B cell malignancies, utilizing the same CAR designs (either 28z or BBz) and targeting a single antigen. While good responses have been sporadically obtained in GBM, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer [[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R55)], the overall responses are not comparable to CD19 CAR therapy. One limitation owes to the paucity of potential targets that, like CD19, are expressed on the surface of nearly all tumor cells and only in dispensable normal cells. Although few if any differentiation antigens meet these two criteria, some proteins overexpressed in tumors, although not tumor-specific, show promise, such as mesothelin, PSMA, GPC3 and a few others [[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R49)]. Targeting tumor antigens that are found in normal tissues may however be possible if one were to calibrate CAR function within a particular therapeutic window in order to limit reactivity to normal cells, carefully selecting scFv’s, signaling components and transcriptional regulation [[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R56)–[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R58)]. Antigen-specific inhibitor CARs may also come of use to protect normal tissues [[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R59)]. [Figure 2B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F2) illustrates the distribution of CAR target antigens currently under clinical investigation for hematologic and solid tumors based on [clinicaltrial.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).\n\nCell surface antigens that are specifically modified in tumor cells are an attractive alternate class of CAR targets. Glycans, including glycolipids, N- and O-linked glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can undergo specific glycosylation in cancer cells. They include Lewis Y in advanced epithelial cancers, sialyl-Lewis A in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, G D2 in neuroblastomas and some gliomas, and Tn-MUC1 in various adenocarcinomas. The involvement of multiple enzymes in glycan biosynthesis and their redundancy accounts for their stable expression and may diminish the risk of antigen escape. Tumor cells would indeed have to lose several of the >20 GalNAc polypeptide transferases that contribute to O-glycosylation to cease generating Tn antigen [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R60), [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R61)]. Glycoprotein expression may however still be lost if the protein backbone were mutated (e.g., loss of MUC1 for Tn- MUC1).\n\n### Tumor infiltration\n\nLike any T cell, CAR T cells need to extravasate into the tumor site and overcome immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to be effective ([Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)). Immune cell trafficking into peripheral tissues is regulated by complex signaling and physical processes that may be significantly disrupted in some tumors. The challenge posed by immunologically “cold tumors” is a general obstacle for all immunotherapies [[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R49)]. T cell engineering however allows for unique solutions. For example, rate limiting entry into the tumor may be alleviated in some cases by chemokine directed migration, for example by overexpressing the IL8 receptor, CXCR2R ([Figure 3A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)), in CAR T cells [[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R62)]. Another approach is to direct CAR T cells to the tumor surroundings, for example, CAR T cells may be targeted to fibroblast associated protein (FAP), which is found in stromal fibroblasts in the TME. CAR T cells targeting FAP effectively infiltrate solid tumors but may also be myelotoxic ([Figure 3B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)) [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R63)]. Another approach makes use of CAR T cells secreting enzymes to forge a path, such as heparanase to degrade heparan sulfate proteoglycans ([Figure 3C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)) [[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R64)].\n\n#### Figure 3.\n\n![Image 11: Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c08d/9392049/9ec42714c452/nihms-1828968-f0003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/figure/F3/)\n\nSelected novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors are illustrated: A. CAR-modified T cells express a chemokine receptor for increasing their ability to traffic/home to the tumor site (e.g., CXCR2). B. FAP specific CAR-T cells can direct CAR-T cells to the tumor surroundings. C. Heparanase expression enhances CAR-T cell forge a path in the TME. D. Intra-tumoral administration of CAR T cells in solid tumors. E. Combination therapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitory receptors to relieve immunosuppression. F. SiRNA to reduce receptor function or exhaustion markers (e.g., silencing the adenosine receptor). G. Engineered CAR T cells that secrete pro-inflammatory or CAR-T supporting cytokines such as IIL-2, IL-7, IL-12 or IL-15. H. A variety of metabolic strategies (e.g., L-Arginine) proposed to be integrated to optimize the manufacturing process and maximize the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells.\n\nLocal/regional CAR T cell delivery in solid tumors may not only maximize the accumulation of CAR T cells at the tumor site but also improve their safety profile by limiting their systemic distribution ([Figure 3D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)). Regional CAR therapy targeting mesothelin in mesothelioma has shown potent and long-lasting CD4-dependent tumor immunity [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R63)]. providing greater anti-tumor efficacy compared to intravenous administration [[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R64)].\n\n### Microenvironmental immune suppression\n\nTumors and their stroma attract and support a number of immunosuppressive cell types, including a heterogeneous population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, Foxp3+ Tregs, fibroblasts and platelets. A broad range of inhibitors acting on TME-associated immune suppression is under investigation [[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R65)]. Overcoming the TME by combining such agents with CAR T cells may prove to be beneficial ([Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)). Blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints that enforce immune suppression is one promising option. Checkpoint inhibition may be achieved by combining CAR T cells with the systemic administration of immune checkpoint inhibitory antibodies [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R63), [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R66), [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R67)] or in cell intrinsic fashion, by ablating for example PD-1 [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R68)] or reducing its function with a dominant-negative receptor [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R63)][[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R59)]. Interfering RNA provides another means to reduce but not fully ablate receptor function, for example silencing the adenosine receptor and other exhaustion markers such as the TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, and KLGR-1 ([Figure 3E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)) [[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R58), [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R69), [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R70)]. Adenosine mediated T cell suppression can be counteracted in other ways as genetic targeting of A 2A R using shRNA [[71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R71)] ([Figure 3F](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)), or by adenosine-responding CAR by fusing the extracellular domain of adenosine receptor to intracellular costimulatory domains, thus converting switching a normally suppressive signal to an activating signal [[72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R72)] .\n\nCAR T cells may be harnessed to reprogram the TME. For example, CAR T cells may provide local cytokine secretion, in order to enhance their infiltration, proliferation and persistence. CAR-expressing T cells can be engineered to produce a wide range of cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-2, IL-7, IL-21, and IL-15) ([Figure 3G](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)) or their cognate receptors, aiming to improve antitumor activity and persistence of these cells. These CAR T cells are sometimes referred to as armored CARs, fourth generation CARs or TRUCKs (T cells redirected for antigen- unrestricted cytokine initiated killing) [[73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R73)]. For example, TRUCKs engineered to inducibly or constitutively express IL-12 have been shown to activate an innate immune anti-tumor response and modify tumor immunosuppression [[74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R74)].\n\nThe heightened glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells may limit nutrients available to CAR T cells in the tumor bed, impeding their function or survival thus affecting the microenvironment and suppressing the immune cells [[75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R75)]. Supplying the CAR T with nutrients using pre-treatment _in vitro_ feeding or inhibiting specific metabolic pathways of the tumor has been shown to enhance CAR T survival, providing for example L-arginine to CAR T cells prior to their adoptive transfer ([Figure 3H](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F3)) [[76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R76)]].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)CAR toxicities\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAR T cells are powerful immune effectors that may in some instances precipitate serious toxicities that require expert and urgent medical management [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R24)–[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R27)]. The occurrence of these acute toxicities is still difficult to predict for any given patient and hinders the broad implementation of CAR therapies.\n\nThe first toxicity was anticipated and owes to the on-target/off-tumor of CAR T cells, resulting in B cell aplasia in the case of CD19 CARs [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R14), [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R77), [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R78)]. Different approaches have been proposed to restrain toxicity to normal cells. One makes use of trans second- generation CARs with split costimulatory configuration combining conventional activating constructs with inhibitory CARs, could potentially enable greater target precision, by ensuring that the effector cells only reach full activation in the presence of a defined array of tumor-associated antigens [[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R79)]. Another approach incorporates inhibitory CARs to retrain T cell function [[80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R80)–[83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R83)]. The unknown toxicity of novel CAR T cells can also be limited by infusing T cells transiently expressing the CAR construct following RNA transfection, thus minimizing the duration of unforeseen toxicity [[84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R84)]. In the context of solid tumors, local delivery of genetically modified T cells could also mitigate toxicities while increasing efficacy [[85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R85)]. Another approach to lower side effects is to find the minimum effective dose. Modeling the amount of CAR T cells needed for a therapeutic effect while reducing the amount of injected CAR T cells to receive a lesser side effect was performed by Globerson Levin et al. and showed the possibility to use far less CAR-T lymphocytes than currently used [[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R79)].\n\nTwo other toxicities, which were not anticipated when the first CD19 CAR trials opened, have posed a greater challenge to date: cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R4), [86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R86)]. Both toxicities occur early on after CAR T cell administration and may be significant in up to a third of all CAR T cell recipients. The mechanisms of CRS are starting to be well understood [[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R87), [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R88)]. Pathological cytokine secretion owes largely to interactions between CAR T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. While activated T cells produce chemokines and cytokines including IL-2, soluble IL-2R-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, soluble IL-6R, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the main source of IL6 and IL1 are macrophages in the vicinity of tumor and CAR T cells. The cornerstone of CRS management is IL6R blockade and corticosteroids [[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R89), [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R90)], but novel interventions including IL1Ra [[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R87), [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R88)], dasatinib [[91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R91)] and others are emerging [[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R86), [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R92), [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R93)]. Neurotoxicity is less well understood and is mainly managed with corticosteroids [[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R86), [94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R94), [95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R95)].\n\nCAR T cell activity may be terminated by reversibly shutting off CAR signaling or irreversibly eliminating CAR T cells through the action of a suicide gene or other elimination switches [[96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R96)]. Suicide genes can be included in the transfection construct, which trigger apoptosis upon induction with a specific drug [[92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R92), [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R93)][[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R87), [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R88)].\n\nThus, while acute CAR T cell toxicity presently limits the widespread use of CAR T cells, one can anticipate this limitation being eventually removed, given the rapid progress in CAR design and our understanding of CRS pathophysiology.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)CAR T cell manufacturing\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### T cell transduction\n\nT cell engineering was initiated with the use of γ-retroviral vectors [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R6), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R8)] and later extended to lentiviral vectors and DNA transposons, all of which mediate stable long-term transgene expression. Messenger RNA transfection may also be used for the purpose of transient CAR expression. Most γ-retroviral vectors are derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus, and have been optimized to promote high level transgene expression [[96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R96)]. Three of the four FDA- approved CAR-T cell products, Breyanzi, Tecartus and Yescarta utilize γ-retroviral vectors to deliver CD19 specific CARs into T cells [[97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R97), [98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R98)]. Most lentiviral vectors are derived from HIV-1 and are pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope [[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R99)]. Both γ-retroviral and lentiviral vectors mediate high level and stable CAR expression. The constitutive expression of the fusogenic VSV-G glycoprotein has so far precluded the establishment of stable packaging cell lines, which is a significant burden for vector production, but lentiviral vectors are effective. Kymriah, the first 4-1BB CAR approved by the FDA and EMA, is a T cell product manufactured with vector produced by transient transfection [[100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R100)]. DNA transposon-based systems, such as Sleeping Beauty (SB), have been developed to produce CAR T cells for clinical investigation and initially demonstrated modest efficacy [[101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R101)]. When compared to viral vectors, the limitation of SB includes the low genetic transposition efficiency hence the need to propagate CAR T cells by stimulation with artificial antigen-presenting cells and cytokines resulting in extended _ex vivo_ culture duration. More recently, site-specific CAR integration using targeted nucleases in conjunction with adeno-associated viral vectors as donor DNA for CAR transcription units, has enabled to tightly regulate CAR expression from the T-cell receptor α chain _(TRAC)_ locus [[102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R102)]. The site-specific double-stranded break enabled by gene editing tools such as CRISPR/cas9 and guide RNAs are subsequently repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) [[103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R103)].\n\n### Autologous CAR T cells\n\nAutologous CAR T cell manufacturing begins with the collection of patient or donor blood or leukapheresis. CD3+ T cells are used as starting cells for CAR T cell manufacturing. Removal of tumor [[104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R104)][[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R99)] cells and monocytes [[105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R105)–[107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R107)] can be mediated by positive selection of CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD4/CD8 T-cell selection has been shown to improve CAR T-cell manufacturing feasibility and resulted in heightened inflammatory toxicities when compared to products derived from whole apheresis, leading to dose de-escalation [[108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R108)] in a phase I clinical trial of patients with relapsed/refractory CD22+ malignancies [[109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R109)]. The generation of CAR T cells from a T cell population with defined properties has the potential to provide a more consistent source of material from one patient to another. It has been shown in animal models that CAR T cells derived from either TN naïve [[110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R110)], TCM central memory [[111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R111), [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R112)] or TSCM memory stem cell subsets [[113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R113)] possess enhanced anti-tumor activities when compared to CAR T cells derived from bulk T cells. CD8 TCM subsets have also been demonstrated to be active in pre-clinical models [[111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R111), [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R112), [114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R114)]. CAR T cells derived from the CD62L+ TCM subset have been used in the clinical setting in patients with glioblastoma and promoted tumor regression in one patient [[115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R115)]. CAR T cells with defined ratios of CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+TCM, or CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ potentially mitigate toxicity and have promoted disease-free survival upon infusion in patients with B-ALL and NHL [[112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R112)]. The possible therapeutic benefit of T cell subsets needs to be evaluated upon long-term patient follow up and in larger patient cohorts to determine if its benefits will justify the increased complexity of the manufacturing scheme and additional costs related to the selection procedure.\n\n### T cell activation\n\nT cell activation with OKT3 antibody can be modulated with costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Off-the-shelf cGMP beads conjugated with anti-CD3 and anti- CD28 antibodies have been developed to optimize T-cell selection and expansion _ex vivo_ (magnetic Dynabeads™ [[116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R116)], T-cell TransAct™ biodegradable nanobeads) [[117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R117), [118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R118)]and are widely used for the activation of T cells in the context of clinical CAR T cell manufacturing [[109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R109)].\n\nAlternatively, artificial antigen presenting cells (AAPCs) such as the K562 CML cells have been customized and decorated with costimulatory molecules to activate and expand subsets of T cells such as CD8+, antigen-specific and CD19-CAR-T cells [[111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R111), [119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R119)]. Irradiated autologous PBMCs [[120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R120)] alone or together with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific LCLs [[121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R121)] in combination with OKT3 antibody and IL2 have also been used to generate CD19- and CD20-specific CAR T cells, respectively. Nonetheless, the number of clinical applications with AAPCs as T cell activators is rather limited due to the complexity of generating AAPCs according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).\n\n### T cell expansion\n\nSeveral platforms such as static culture in flasks and bags, wave-mixed bioreactors and expansion in continuous bioreactors are available to enable manufacturing of clinical CAR T cells (reviewed in Wang and Riviere) [[117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R117)]. Wave-mixed bioreactors are wildly used by academic centers and biotech companies for CAR T cell expansion to support early stage clinical trials [[109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R109)]. Other integrated manufacturing platforms such as the CliniMACS Prodigy System are fully enclosed and designed to incorporate T cell selection, activation, transduction, expansion and formulation, enabling a higher degree of automation, supporting continuous cell culture, and largely decreasing interpersonal operator variability. Phase I clinical trials conducted with CD19 CAR T cells manufactured in the CliniMACS Prodigy have generated encouraging clinical responses which have the potential to enable the concept of point-of-care manufacturing [[122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R122)–[126](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R126)]. Another newly available integrated end-to-end cell manufacturing solution is the Cocoon platform, which is currently being investigated in a clinical trial at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel [[127](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R127)]([NCT02772198](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02772198)). The need to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of autologous patient derived T cells is prompting the development of new culture reagents, technologies, and manufacturing platforms [[128](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R128)]. In particular, minimally manipulated CAR T cells kept in culture for less than 24hr have demonstrated some level of anti-tumor activities in animal models and in human subjects. The optimization of this approach could simplify CAR-T manufacturing and has the potential to drastically decrease the overall cost [[129](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R129), [130](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R130)].\n\n### Allogeneic CAR T cells\n\nWhile autologous CAR T cell therapies require a bespoke manufacturing process for every patient leukapheresis, off-the-shelf and allogeneic CAR therapies offer the prospect of eluding the variable quality and impairment of patient T cells, reducing the variability in yield and homogenizing the phenotype of infused CAR T cells. Allogeneic CAR T cells would also shorten the delay to T cell infusion once CAR T cells were prescribed. Allogeneic approaches however face two major challenges. The first is the risk of causing graft- versus-host disease (GVHD) and the second is the rapid elimination of allogeneic cells by the host immune system, limiting their anti-tumor activity. Several solutions are available to address the first challenge, using either allogeneic CAR T cells derived from a stem cell transplant donor, virus-specific memory T cells, non-αβ T cells and/or gene editing to ablate TCR expression, reviewed in [[131](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R131)]. The second challenge, to avoid rapid elimination, is more complex and still awaits an effective solution.\n\n### T-iPS\n\nThe generation of immune cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an alternative platform to produce “off-the-shelf” and synthetic allogeneic T-cells [[132](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R132)]. Proof-of-principle studies support the feasibility of this approach [[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R133), [134](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R134)]. iPS-derived NK cells have already entered the clinic ([NCT03841110](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841110)) and iPS-derived T cells will be investigated shortly in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Lymphoma ([NCT04629729](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04629729)).\n\n### In vivo CAR T cell generation\n\nCAR T cells could potentially be engineered _in vivo_, altogether by-passing _ex vivo_ manufacturing. This technology is at very early stage of development and its potential remains unknown. Early studies using γ-retroviral vectors, adenoviral vectors and lipid nanoparticles, suggest the feasibility of transducing T cells in vivo [[84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R84), [135](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R135)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Genetic engineering and genome editing\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGenome editing offers new prospects for T cell engineering [[136](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R136)]. The precision afforded by CRISPR, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) is useful to not only knock-out endogenous genes but also to knock-in transgenes [[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R137)]. T cells edited to remove their endogenous TCR or inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 have already been tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R68), [138](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R138)–[140](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R140)]. The abrogation of HLA class I expression via the ablation of ß 2-microglobulin is being actively pursued to build allogeneic universal CAR T cells [[141](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R141)]. These mechanisms allow efficient and relatively simple gene knock-out and are pursued for the generation of universal T cells, exhaustion- resistant T cells, and to reduce the off-target toxicity of redirected T cells by fratricide[[142](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R142)].\n\nClinical trials using either TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 for gene ablation are summarized in [[136](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R136)]. Currently 4 clinical trials make use of TALEN technology and a dozen utilize CRISPR/Cas9 to address, exhaustion, fratricide killing or allo-rejection. The preclinical results and data from early clinical trials are encouraging [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R68)], but more clinical experience with these technologies, in particular CRISPR-Cas9, is required to confirm safety and efficacy.\n\nPrecision engineering may also be used to insert genes at selected genomic locations to achieve regulated transgene expression. Thus, CARs expressed from the _TRAC_ locus, which encodes the T cell receptor alpha chain, are expressed at an optimal level that is sufficient for effective expression but minimizes tonic signaling and premature T cell exhaustion [[102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R102)]. _TRAC_ targeting, which simultaneously ablates endogenous TCR expression, has since been adopted by many groups developing allogeneic approaches, while we pursue this approach to demonstrate that the generation of optimally engineered CAR T cells will reduce T cell dosing and toxicities in the autologous setting. We are also actively searching for genomic safe harbors [[143](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R143)] to engineer CARs and other transgenes to reliably regulate expression of cytokines, chemokines, secreted scFv’s, bites and other molecules in CAR T cells.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Novel cell types and technologies using CAR therapy\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Virus-specific T cells (VST), natural killer (NK), invariant NKT cells.\n\nOne of the major evolutions of CAR therapy is the diversification of cell source [[132](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R132)] ([Figure 2C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F2)). CAR constructs were initially investigated in conventional αβ-T cells, but are now investigated using other cell types including virus-specific T cells (VST), natural killer (NK), invariant NKT cells, γδ-T cells and myeloid cells. At first, memory cells with specificity towards human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were evaluated. EBV and CMV infections induce a CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell pools with an effector-memory phenotype. CMV T cells isolated and used for transduction in an attempt to increase T cell persistence were evaluated [[144](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R144), [145](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R145)]. CARs are also being investigated in γδ-T cells[[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R133), [146](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R146)], invariant NKT cells [[147](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R147)] and NK cells [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R45)]. NK cells have become highly attractive for their potent effector functions and safety based on their cytokine secretion profile and lack of induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic settings [[148](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R148)]. Similar characteristics can be attributed to NKT cells. G D2 CAR NKT cells have been administered to patients with neuroblastoma[[149](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R149)]. Still, over 96% of all CAR clinical trials use conventional αβ-T cells for CAR T cells manufacturing ([Figure 2C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#F2)).\n\n### γδ T cells\n\nA small subset of peripheral blood cytotoxic T cells are the γδ-T cell. Similar to CAR T cells, they do not need antigenic presentation by MHC molecules for recognition and function. γδ-T cells function across MHC-barriers, and do not cause graft-vs-host disease. Their anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated using Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in preclinical studies and early phase CD20 CAR γδ T cells for r/r NHL ([NCT04735471](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04735471)) [[146](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R146)].\n\n### Macrophages\n\nThe ability of macrophages to infiltrate solid tumors and be reprogrammed, as well as the antitumor effects associated with a switch to the M1 phenotype, have been exploited in cancer immunotherapy and make these cells a desirable carrier for CARs. CAR macrophages (CAR-M) have been shown to reduce the tumor burden and prolonged overall survival in mice [[150](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R150)]. The potential of engineered CAR macrophages in cancer immunotherapy was recently illustrated in an _in vivo_ mouse model of HER2-expressing ovarian cancer cells [[151](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R151)].\n\n### CAR T exosomes\n\nAlbeit acellular, this approach derives from cell-based approaches, aiming to enhance tumor infiltration by using exosomes that carry CARs on their surface [[152](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R152)]. CAR-containing exosomes express a high level of cytotoxic molecules and can inhibit tumor growth without CRS [[153](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R153)]. Their potential toxicity of T cell-derived exosomes remains to be investigated.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)CARs beyond cancer\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInfectious disease still represents a major threat worldwide. Despite the availability of a range of treatment options, the incidence rates and mortality rates of some infectious diseases remain high, exemplified by the COVID19 pandemic. T cells play a key role in the control of most of these diseases, supporting the potential application of T cell-based therapeutic approaches, such as CAR-T-cell therapy. Other non-malignant diseases including colitis, systemic lupus, GVHD, autoimmune diseases, fungal diseases, cardiac fibrosis and cellular senescence may also benefit from CAR T cells [[154](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R154)].\n\n### Infectious diseases\n\nThe gp120 envelope protein expressed in HIV-infected T cells has been targeted by engineered CD4 and CD8+ T-cells [[144](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R144), [155](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R155)]. Another approach is based on HIV-specific CAR-T cells lacking CCR5 expression, which exhibited antiviral effects. This approach blocks virus propagation, and importantly, precludes integration of the virus into the host genome where it could persist in a latent state. There are still limitations such as CAR T-cell expansion, persistence, and potential off-target effects. A similar approach could be used to target other viruses including CMV, and HBV [[154](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R154)]\n\n### Transplantation and autoimmunity\n\nHLA-A2-specific CAR Tregs have been used to protect against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and skin transplant rejection in immunodeficient mice. Human HLA molecules in the context of HLA-disparate transplantation are ideal targets for CARs, as the antigen is abundant and expressed solely on the transplanted organ, thus will affect only on the grafted T cells eliminating the GVHD. Moreover, the ligation of HLA molecules by CAR Tregs is unlikely to have any negative effect on graft cell function, as these molecules have no signaling potential [[154](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R154)].\n\nTreating autoimmune diseases is another new focus of CAR therapy. Several approaches are in pre-clinical development to target different autoimmune mechanisms: 1. Targeting the soluble antibodies formed by using a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR T) to inhibit autoantibody reaction; 2. Using T regs to inhibit T cell autoreactivity, and 3. Eliminating autoreactive B cells to halt the accumulation of autoantibodies by directing the CAR T against the specific B cell [[156](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R156), [157](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R157)]. Specifically, treatment with ex vivo expanded Tregs has shown promise in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), albeit with impaired Treg accumulation and function at inflammatory sites. Tregs can be efficiently transduced to express functional, antigen- specific chimeric receptors that enable the specific suppression of effector T cells. This approach may enable future cell-based therapeutic applications in inflammatory bowel disease, as well as other inflammatory disorders [[155](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R155), [158](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R158)–[160](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R160)].\n\n### Senolytic CARs\n\nSenescence is a cellular program that leads to irreversible cell cycle arrest in response to stress. Defective immune clearance of senescent cells results in the latter’s accumulation and the establishment of a pro-inflammatory environment that contributes to a variety of pathologies associated with chronic tissue damage and aging, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and some neurodegenerative conditions [[161](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R161)]. As shown in mouse models of liver fibrosis, CAR T cells directed to cell surface markers selectively expressed on the surface of senescent cells can function as effective senolytic agents [[162](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R162)], opening a path for developing engineered immune cells to remove senescent cells and abrogate inflammation in a number of pathologies.\n\nCardiac diseases are a leading cause for mortality worldwide. Most myocardial diseases lead to cardiac fibrosis, which diminishes organ function and contributes to heart failure. In a murine model of cardiac injury induced by angiotensin II and phenylephrine, CAR T cells targeting FAP in interstitial fibroblasts have also been shown to facilitate myocardial regeneration, without adversely affecting wound healing [[163](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/#R163)]. Perivascular fibrosis persisted, consistent with the absence of FAP expression in perivascular fibroblasts, but without myelotoxicity. Altogether, the studies support the potential of CAR therapy to address pathologies associated with senescence, fibrosis and chronic inflammation.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Conclusions and prospects\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD19 CAR T therapy has opened Pandora’s box for cell-based immunotherapy and synthetic immunology. These advances will rest on progress in receptor and circuit design, tumor immunology, genetic engineering and cell manufacturing sciences. The clinical results achieved with CD19 CAR T cells over the past 10 years have swayed the pharmaceutical industry to explore and invest in cell-based immune therapy, which no previous adoptive cell therapy had achieved. Considerable work lies ahead to develop a range of personalized therapies, which will require the identification of suitable targets, overcoming the tumor microenvironment, breaking into cold tumors, minimizing toxicities and further advancing T cell manufacturing, whether in autologous, allogeneic or _in vivo_ settings. The potential of immunotherapy using CAR T cells is vast in cancer and beyond, including autoimmunity, senescence-associated pathologies and infectious diseases. While the challenges remain considerable, it seems that more applications will arise, and that the CAR T cell era is only at its beginning.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Acknowledgments:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank Tova Waks for her scientific review and her assistance in gathering the data for statistical analysis of CAR T clinical trials.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)Footnotes\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConflict of interest: ZE and MS have several patents relating to CAR technologies.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9392049/)References\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   1.Sadelain M, CAR therapy: the CD19 paradigm.

        "content": "CD22 is a cell-surface molecule that, like CD19, is broadly and uniquely expressed by B-lineage cells148,149. Interestingly, downregulation of CD22 seems to be the major mechanism of escape following anti-CD22 CAR-T cell therapy, probably related to the relative lower efficacy of CD22 CAR-T and the tendency of CD22 to be internalized. CD22-directed CAR-T cells have been investigated in paediatric and adult patients with relapse or refractory (R/R) B-ALL as well as in adult NHL after failure of CD19 CAR-T cell therapy150,151. In a single-institution phase I dose-escalation trial, three patients with LBCL and six patients with ALL received CD22 CAR-T cell therapy after a median of six previous lines of treatment, including previous CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy. All patients with LBCL [...] These CAR-T cell products contain one receptor molecule with two binding domains able to recognize two targets on the cognate tumour cell. On the basis of clear evidence that both CD19 antigen loss following CD19-directed immunotherapy and diminished CD22 cell-surface expression contribute to relapse, the group of Fry176 designed a bispecific anti-CD19–CD22 CAR (CD19-22. BB.z-CAR) that simultaneously targets both antigens and preserved bifunctionality against both CD19 and CD22. This loop CD19–CD22 CAR showed strong preclinical data of efficient killing of CD19+CD22+, CD19+CD22− and CD19− CD22+ B-ALL tumours in xenograft models176. This bispecific CAR has progressed to phase I clinical trials for both children and adults with R/R B-ALL (NCT03241940) and R/R CD19+ DLBCL (NCT03233854) and [...] This approach uses a single T cell product to express two CARs that recognize different antigens. This can be achieved by different approaches. T cells can be co-transduced with two different vectors to create a T cell product with a mixed population, in which some of the cells are transduced with one or both vectors. An alternative strategy uses bicistronic vectors that enable the co-expression of two different CAR molecules on the same T cell. A recent study documented dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 against B-ALL by using a novel anti-CD22 CAR construct able to recognize cells with low CD22 density and lacking tonic signalling170. CAR-T cells in the study were co-transduced with two separate vectors: anti-CD22 CAR (9A8-41BBζ) and anti-CD19 CAR (CAT-41BBζ). The obtained CAR-T cell",

Nevertheless, resistance to CAR-T cell therapies occurs in most patients. In this Review, we summarize the resistance mechanisms to CAR-T cell immunotherapy by analysing CAR-T cell dysfunction, intrinsic tumour resistance and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. We discuss current research strategies to overcome multiple resistance mechanisms, including optimization of the CAR design, improvement of in vivo T cell function and persistence, modulation of the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and synergistic combination strategies.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Introduction\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have revolutionized the field of cancer therapy and are considered one of the major medical breakthroughs of the past few decades. So far, the FDA has approved six CAR-T cell products for haematological malignancies, including products targeting the CD19 antigen for B cell leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for multiple myeloma[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R1)-[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R8). These novel therapies were initially approved based on impressive results in single-arm phase II studies that were later confirmed by real-world data analyses[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R9)-[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R14).\n\nDespite these compelling results, most patients treated with CAR-T cells ultimately have progressive disease. This can be due to an initial lack of response or primary resistance, which is the case in 10–30% of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), roughly 50% of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), around 10% of mantle cell lymphoma, 5–15% of follicular lymphoma and 20% of multiple myeloma. Alternatively, disease progression can be due to relapse after an initial, transient response, also known as secondary resistance, which is the case of roughly 40–50% of B-ALL and DLBCL, 40% of mantle cell lymphoma, 30% of follicular lymphoma and 30% of multiple myeloma[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R1)-[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R3),[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R7),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R8),[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R15)-[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R18). Several mechanisms of resistance to CAR-T cell immunotherapy have been identified ([Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F1)), namely, CAR-T cell dysfunction ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F2)), tumour-intrinsic mechanisms ([Fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F3)) and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) ([Fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F4)). These mechanisms must be studied to develop more effective strategies to achieve durable responses in patients. This Review summarizes the most recent findings on the clinical and correlative resistance mechanisms to CAR-T cell immunotherapy and discusses the most promising approaches to overcome resistance.\n\n### Fig. 1 ∣. Overview of CAR-T cell resistance mechanisms.\n\n[![Image 9: Fig. 1 ∣](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/79c9/10965011/4f56ba9ca7d3/nihms-1971431-f0001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10965011_nihms-1971431-f0001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/figure/F1/)\n\nSeveral mechanisms of resistance to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy have been identified and can be broadly related to CAR-T cell dysfunction (1), tumour-intrinsic resistance (2) or the surrounding immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (3). CAR-T cells from responders are characterized by a more naive and central memory phenotype, as opposed to exhausted or dysfunctional CAR-T cells from non-responders. In addition, many tumour-intrinsic resistance mechanisms, beyond antigen-negative relapse, have been characterized. A ‘hot’ tumour microenvironment with high CAR-T cell infiltration, polarization and trafficking is usually predictive of a better response.\n\n### Fig. 2 ∣. Mechanisms of CAR-T cell dysfunction.\n\n[![Image 10: Fig. 2 ∣](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/79c9/10965011/0790c75d52db/nihms-1971431-f0002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10965011_nihms-1971431-f0002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/figure/F2/)\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell exhaustion is characterized by the sequential reduction of T cell effector functions, such as their ability to induce tumour lysis, produce cytokines and proliferate. (1) CAR-T cell activation requires binding to antigen-positive tumour cells. Persistent antigen stimulation and/or tonic CAR signalling result in CAR-T cell exhaustion. (2) Other factors contributing to exhaustion are the presence of immunosuppressive cell types in the tumour microenvironment (myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T (T reg) cells and tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)) and immunosuppressive ligands (IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)). (3) Gene expression and epigenetic changes consistent with CAR-T cell exhaustion include activation of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) and the thymus high-mobility group box protein (TOX)–NR4A axis that drive the exhaustion programme of T cells and promote the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors (IRs) such as programmed cell death 1 (PD1), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM3) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4). (4) External factors and signals coming from IRs (such as PD1) compromise CAR-T cell metabolism. Exhausted CAR-T cells have an impaired ability to use aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and upregulate the glucose transporter (GLUT1) to compensate for the lack of glucose.

Tumour-intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to CAR-T cells.\n\n[![Image 11: Fig. 3 ∣](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/79c9/10965011/6929a270c63b/nihms-1971431-f0003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10965011_nihms-1971431-f0003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/figure/F3/)\n\nSeveral tumour-intrinsic mechanisms have been described as factors associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell failure. Owing to tumour heterogeneity, pre-existing antigen-negative tumour cells can be responsible for resistance to CAR-T cell therapy. (1) For CD19, antigen point mutations or alternative splicing result in a different form of the antigen (such as truncated) that can no longer be recognized by CAR-T cells. Antigen loss might also be due to defects in target antigen maturation and trafficking due to a lack of appropriate chaperons. (2) Tumour expression of inhibitory ligands, such as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) or CD80, inhibits CAR-T activation and induces exhaustion, independently of antigen-target recognition. (3) Impaired apoptotic machinery in the tumour cells or downregulation of cell death receptors at the tumour level can confer tumour resistance to apoptosis induced by CAR-T cells. (4) Lineage switch may be responsible for complete phenotypic changes, including the loss of the target antigen. (5) CAR sensitivity depends on CAR binding to the antigen and antigen level of expression, but it is also increased when the tumour cells express the correct ligands for CAR co-accessory molecules. Defects in the engagement of co-accessory molecules (such as the loss of CD58 expression on tumour cells) can result from inefficient accessory receptors and CAR-T cell activation. CTLA4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; IFNγR, IFNγ receptor; LAG3, lymphocyte activation gene 3; PD1, programmed cell death 1; TIM3, T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.\n\n### Fig. 4 ∣. Tumour microenvironment barriers to CAR-T cell therapy.\n\n[![Image 12: Fig. 4 ∣](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/79c9/10965011/53c33547634e/nihms-1971431-f0004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10965011_nihms-1971431-f0004.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/figure/F4/)\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells might encounter environmental barriers that prevent their ability to infiltrate the tumour and activate and kill the target cells. (1) Barriers to CAR-T cell infiltration include tumour vasculature with downregulated expression of endothelial adhesion molecules by endothelial cells, which is necessary for T cell migration from the endothelium into tumours, as well defects in vascular permeability and the deposition of a fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) that physically blocks T cell migration and lowers T cell motility. (2) Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T (T reg) cells contribute to CAR-T cell exhaustion. T reg cells present in the tumour microenvironment (TME), for example, often express the inhibitory ligand programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1), which is able to suppress CAR-T cell functionality. In addition, immunosuppressive cells and tumour cells secrete inhibitory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)) that also diminish the effector function of CAR-T cells. (3) Finally, tumour cells compete with CAR-T cells for nutrients (such as glucose and tryptophan) and oxygen.

In the registration studies for DLBCL (JULIET and ZUMA-1 trials), rates of complete remission ranged from 39% to 58%[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R4),[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R13),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R19). The registration trials for each product had differences in design and patient populations and cannot be directly compared. However, notably, primary resistance was observed in 42% of patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), in 61% of patients treated with tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and in 47% of patients treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel). These results demonstrate that, overall, primary resistance of lymphoma to CD19-directed CAR-T cells occurs in approximately half of the treated patients.\n\nBy contrast, B-ALL seems to be more responsive to CAR-T cell therapy, with 81% of paediatric patients with B-ALL achieving complete remission with tisa-cel in the ELIANA study and adults having a complete remission rate of 53–60% with brexucabtagene autoleucel in the ZUMA-3 study[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R3),[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R6),[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R20). In the ZUMA-2 trial, 68% of patients with mantle cell lymphoma treated with brexucabtagene autoleucel had complete remission, whereas patients with follicular lymphoma who received axi-cel in the ZUMA-5 study had a 74% complete remission rate[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R16),[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R17). Finally, in multiple myeloma, a complete remission to therapy was achieved in 67–79% across the two approved BCMA-targeted products: idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R7),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R8). In larger real-world studies, complete remission rates of 53–65% were reported for axi-cel and 40–42% for tisa-cel, which were comparable to results of ZUMA-1 and JULIET trials, respectively[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R10),[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R21)-[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R23). Therefore, a significant need exists to reduce the incidence of primary resistance, particularly in DLBCL and adult B-ALL.\n\nSecondary resistance, by contrast, is observed when a patient relapses after achieving a complete remission. The time of relapse varies according to the disease treated and the product used. At a median follow-up of 40 months, patients who received tisa-cel for DLBCL achieved an overall survival of 11.1 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.9 months[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R13). A follow-up analysis of axi-cel from the ZUMA-1 study, with a median follow-up of 63.1 months, displayed a 5-year overall survival rate of 43% and median PFS of 5.9 months[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R24),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R25). For liso-cel, with a median follow-up of 12.3 months, the median overall survival was not reached[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R26). Updated results of tisa-cel in B-ALL displayed a 24-month relapse-free survival rate of 62% and 18-month overall survival rate of 70%[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R27). Real-world results in the same setting reported comparable results with an overall survival rate of 77.2% (median follow-up of 13.4 months)[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R23). Patients with mantle cell lymphoma within the ZUMA-2 study had a duration of response, PFS and overall survival of 28.2, 25.8 and 46.6 months, respectively[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R16). For multiple myeloma, 2-year follow-ups for idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel achieved median durations of response of 11.1 and 21.8 months (median PFS of 9.8 months and 24-month PFS of 54.9–60.5%), respectively[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R28)-[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R30).\n\nThe identification of the determinants, mechanisms and prognostic factors driving primary resistance and secondary resistance (or relapse) is an area of very active research[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R31). Several studies have investigated clinical and laboratory parameters that are routinely evaluated in patients and correlate with inferior outcomes. For instance, lower disease burden correlates with lower toxicity and increased efficacy, a principle that applies across multiple treatment modalities and types of disease in oncology[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R32). In addition, a higher number of CAR-T cells at peak or area under the curve levels of CAR-positive T cells in blood correlate with a longer durability of response[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R33). Moreover, in both tisa-cel and axi-cel for DLBCL, risk factors for disease relapse included worse performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade ≥2), higher stage disease, ≥2 extranodal sites, elevated laboratory parameters of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) and high International Prognostic Index[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R34). High ferritin pretreatment levels have been associated with lower CAR-T cell expansion[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R34),[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R35). In addition, lower prelymphodepletion levels of LDH as well as a higher number of platelets were independent factors associated with better event-free survival[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R36). Patients with active disease who require ‘bridging chemotherapy’ (anticancer treatment administered between apheresis and lymphodepleting chemotherapy with the aim of preventing the progression of the disease during this interval) had worse overall survival[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R10). Thus, despite the overall success of CAR-T cell therapies in haematological malignancies, primary and especially secondary resistance are important clinical problems.\n\nThe next sections explore the biologic mechanisms of resistance to CAR-T cells, which are divided into T cell-related mechanisms (such as failure in CAR-T cell manufacturing or T cell exhaustion) ([Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F2)), tumour-intrinsic mechanisms (such as the loss of target antigen expression, expression of immune checkpoint molecules or resistance to apoptosis) ([Fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F3)) and immunosuppressive TME-related mechanisms (such as barrier to CAR-T cell infiltration, presence of immunosuppressive cells and cytokines or lack of nutrients or hypoxia) ([Fig. 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#F4)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)CAR-T cell dysfunction\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe role of T cell differentiation in CAR-T cell persistence is key for understanding the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy (reviewed recently[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R37)). T cell differentiation refers to the process by which T cells transition from a naive state to an effector or memory state with distinct functional characteristics. In CAR-T cell therapy, the persistence of CAR-T cells within the body of the patient is closely linked to their ability to maintain their effector functions targeting cancer cells over an extended period. Less differentiated T cell subsets, such as central memory T cells and stem cell memory T cells, tend to have superior persistence than more differentiated effector memory T cells and terminally differentiated effector cells. Central memory T cell and stem cell memory T cell subsets have self-renewal capabilities and can proliferate on re-encountering the antigen, thereby sustaining CAR-T cell populations over time. By contrast, the presence of highly differentiated subsets, such as terminally differentiated effector cells, can lead to a decrease in CAR-T cell persistence due to their limited proliferative potential and increased susceptibility to exhaustion or apoptosis. Dysfunctional T cells may develop owing to multiple causes including prolonged antigen stimulation, previous lymphotoxic therapies, immunodeficiencies or other undetermined factors[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R38). Dysfunctional T cells can be exhausted or senescent (reviewed elsewhere[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R39)) and show lower expansion capacity, reduced cytotoxic function and higher expression of inhibitory receptors[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R38),[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R39). Methods to reduce exhaustion and senescence represent a strategy to enhance CAR-T cell functionality, and several approaches are being studied. [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#T1) provides an overview of clinical trials evaluating new strategies to overcome CAR-T cell dysfunction, in particular, studies regarding blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and its ligand, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1); blockade of PD1 and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT); the combination of CAR-T cells with signal transduction inhibition via BTK-dependent and independent mechanisms; and the use of natural killer (NK) cells instead of T cells.\n\n### Table 1 ∣.\n\nClinical trials that address CAR-T cell dysfunction\n\n| [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) identifier | Country | Disease | Construct | Summary of results (if available) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **PD1–PDL1 blockade** |\n| [NCT03044743](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03044743) | China | EBV-associated malignancies (DLBCL, among others) | EBV cytotoxic lymphocytes | NA |\n| [NCT04163302](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04163302) | China | BCL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| [NCT03298828](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03298828) | China | B cell malignancies | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| [NCT04539444](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04539444) | Taiwan | BCL | Anti-CD19/CD22 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| [NCT03258047](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03258047) | China | BCL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | CD19–PD1/CD28–CAR-T are safe and effective in PDL1+ BCL[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R79) |\n| [NCT04381741](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04381741) | China | DLBCL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| **PD1–TIGIT blockade** |\n| [NCT04836507](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04836507) | Republic of Korea | LBCL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| **Combining CAR therapy with signal transduction inhibition via BTK-dependent and BTK-independent mechanisms** |\n| [NCT01747486](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01747486) | USA | CLL/SLL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | NA |\n| [NCT02640209](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02640209) | USA | CLL/SLL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | Adding autologous anti-CD19 humanized binding domain T cells to ibrutinib in patients with CLL not in complete remission led to deep and durable remissions[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R87) |\n| [NCT03331198](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03331198) | USA | CLL/SLL | Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell | Administration of ibrutinib in combination with CAR-T cells was well tolerated and might decrease the incidence of severe cytokine release syndrome and improve responses[216](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R216) |\n| **Using NK cells instead of T cells** |\n| [NCT03056339](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03056339) | USA | B cell malignancies | Anti-CD19 CAR NK cell | Patients achieved response to treatment without the development of major toxic effects[120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R120) |\n| [NCT05020678](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05020678) | USA/Australia | B cell malignancies | Anti-CD19 CAR NK cell | NA |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/table/T1/)\n\nBCL, B cell lymphoma; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; DLBCL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; NA, not applicable; LBCL, large B cell lymphoma; NCT, National Clinical Trial, NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer; PD1, programmed cell death 1; PDL1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; SLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma; TIGIT, T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains.\n\nExhausted T cells were initially described in chronic viral infection and are characterized by the co-expression of several inhibitory receptors, including PD1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), TIGIT and others[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R38),[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R40)-[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R42). The number and abundance of expression of inhibitory receptors correlate with the severity of T cell dysfunction. In addition, exhausted T cells show impaired cytokine secretion (IFNγ, IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)) and limited cytotoxicity. Exhausted T cells also express transcription factors associated with effector and memory cells, such as nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) and the downstream effector NR4A, the nuclear thymus high-mobility group box protein (TOX), T-bet or eomesodermin, and adopt a unique epigenetic landscape[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R43), resulting in the induction of an exhaustion programme that prevents T cell overstimulation and reduces the response of T cells to tumour.\n\nSpecifically, in CAR-T cell therapy, preclinical evidence shows that exhausted CD8+ CAR-T cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from a mouse model carrying a CD19+ B16-OVA melanoma xenograft showed overexpression of PD1 and TIM3 and a similar enrichment for consensus binding motifs for NR4A and NFAT transcription factors[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R44),[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R45). In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), transcriptomic analysis after tisa-cel infusion showed that T cells from non-responders had upregulated pathways associated with T cell exhaustion, effector differentiation, glycolysis and apoptosis compared with T cells from responders. Co-expression of PD1, LAG3 and TIM3 was also upregulated on these CAR-T cells[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R31). A highly significant association was seen between the likelihood of responding to therapy and the infusion of high doses of CD27+PD1−CD8+ CAR-T cells. Similarly, durable remission was associated with a higher frequency of memory-like T cells (CD27+CD45RO−CD8+) and a higher frequency of IL-6 and STAT3-related gene signatures at apheresis. In the JULIET study that led to the approval of tisa-cel for DLBCL and transformed follicular lymphoma, patients with the highest PD1–PDL1 interaction scores and high proportions of LAG3+ T cells either did not respond to tisa-cel or relapsed shortly after[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R46). A multicentre retrospective study reported that among 76 patients with B cell lymphoma (BCL), all three patients with PDL1+ tumour had primary resistance to axi-cel therapy. In addition, recent studies have shown how PDL1+ DLBCL is refractory to anti-CD19− CAR-T cell treatment but that administration of the PD1-blocking antibody pembrolizumab resulted in an expansion of CAR-T cells and tumour regression[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R47).\n\nOne challenge of autologous CAR-T cell therapy is that T cells come directly from the patient, and patients with haematological malignancies, especially those patients who have had multiple lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy, have more senescent T cells and fewer of the memory-like CD8+ cells that are associated with durable remissions after CAR-T therapy[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R31),[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R48). Therefore, the status of T cells at infusion influences the response to CAR-T cell therapy, and monitoring CAR-T cell polyfunctionality preinfusion has proven to be a key attribute in predicting clinical response. A single-cell analysis of the pre-infusion axi-cel product from patients with NHL[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R49) showed that CAR products contain polyfunctional T cell subsets capable of deploying multiple immune programmes (cytokines and chemokines). A prespecified T cell polyfunctionality strength index applied to a pre-infusion axi-cel product was significantly associated with clinical response. Combined with CAR-T cell expansion or pretreatment serum IL-15 levels, polyfunctionality strength index confers additional significance ([NCT00924326](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00924326))[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R49).\n\nOther work has shown promise by using a preselection of T cells during manufacturing, as it allows the removal of potentially dysfunctional T cells[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R50). Preselected naive/stem memory T cells provided higher antitumour activity and displayed less susceptibility to toxicity induced by CAR-T cells[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R51).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Strategies to overcome CAR-T cell dysfunction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Optimization of the CAR-T cell product\n\nMany previous reviews have discussed at length the various CAR construct designs, particularly the binder, hinge domain and co-stimulation domains that can increase CAR-T cell antigen recognition, signalling and persistence[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R52),[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R53). Here, we focus on other aspects beyond CAR design that can influence the CAR-T cell product.\n\nIn most patients with haematological malignancies, T cells are exhausted and terminally differentiated owing to the presence of the tumour and previous cytotoxic treatments. Despite ex vivo activation and engineering, CAR-T cells derived from these patients perform somewhat poorly relative to T cells derived from young, healthy donors. A potential strategy to decrease the fraction of dysfunctional T cells is to start with less-differentiated, marrow-infiltrating T cells instead of circulating peripheral blood T cells, but this requires a more invasive procedure[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R54). Alternatively, T cells harvested early in the disease course and, thus with less exposure to lymphotoxic therapies, could retain better fitness and proliferative capacity than those collected after relapse[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R55). Although, the presence of disease at any stage may affect T cell function and be present in the final product[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R56). The efficacy and safety of axi-cel as a first-line therapy in patients with high-risk large BCL (LBCL) was tested in ZUMA-12 ([NCT03761056](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03761056))[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R57). The trial identified that a higher proportion of naive-like T cells (CCR7+CD45RA+) is associated with greater expansion of CAR-T cells than ZUMA-1, which suggests that the inclusion of CAR-T cells in earlier lines enhances T cell function and, therefore, clinical efficacy.\n\nShortening the culture period of CAR-T cells also favours a more cytotoxic and less-differentiated cellular product. Highly functional CAR-T cells can be generated within a day by leveraging the unique ability of lentiviral vectors to enter and integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells. Minimizing ex vivo manipulation preserved less-exhausted T cells and could also be of particular benefit to patients with rapidly progressive disease, who may otherwise be unable to receive the therapy[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R58). Of course, it still needs to be determined whether the delivery time to the patient will be significantly shortened, owing to the time needed to complete testing before release for the patient.\n\nTo better understand the mechanisms leading to exhaustion, Lynn et al.[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R59) recently developed a cellular model of exhaustion by introducing a tonic signalling CAR (HA-28z CAR) into T cells. Chromatin accessibility paired with gene expression analysis revealed increased accessibility of the transcription factor, activator protein 1 (AP-1) motif and preferential binding of IRF4 and BATF over JUN because those transcription factors compete for the same sites. The forced overexpression of JUN prevented the exhaustion by promoting direct transcriptional activation of AP-1 target genes as well as by indirectly disrupting immunoregulatory AP-1–IRF transcriptional complexes that drive exhaustion-associated gene expression. These results showed how epigenetics and transcriptional reprogramming could revert CAR-T cell exhaustion.\n\nA positive balance in favour of CAR-T cell proliferation over exhaustion can be stimulated with cytokines. Increased antitumour activity has been documented in CAR-T cells expressing a constitutively active form of the IL-7 receptor along with the CAR or insertion of the IL-15 receptor within the CAR construct[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R60),[61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R61). Additional transgenes can also be incorporated into the same vector constructs to enhance CAR-T cell persistence, such as BCL-2 family members[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R62),[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R63). Avoiding cell death could also be accomplished with dominant-negative FAS overexpression[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R64) or FAS–41BB switch receptors[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R65). Emerging data from genome-wide CRISPR screens in CAR-T cells also indicate that deletion of other genes (such as _RASA2_) may enhance CAR-T cell manufacturing, persistence or function[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R66),[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R67). One challenge for the field is that the number of potential edits, transgenes and knockouts that can be hypothesized and tested in preclinical models far exceeds the number of potential products that could feasibly be clinically developed for patients.\n\n### Immune checkpoint blockade\n\nPD1 blockade might overcome PDL1+ tumour immunosuppression, thereby considerably enhancing the anticancer activity of human CAR-T cells against haematological and potentially solid tumours[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R68)-[71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R71). PD1 blockade by using antibodies has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy in various cancer types by reinvigorating anticancer T cell immunity; however, at the same time, immune-related adverse events have been observed, in particular, autoimmunity.\n\nA study focusing on adding PD1 blockade to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in 14 children (13 of whom were receiving pembrolizumab and 1 receiving nivolumab) with heavily pretreated, refractory B-ALL resulted in an improvement in the persistence of CAR-T cells, and 50% (7 of 14 patients) maintained either a complete or a partial response[72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R72). In addition, three of the patients treated with a PD1 inhibitor developed recurrent B cell aplasia, suggesting sustained CAR-T cell function.\n\nTargeted modulation of PD1 in CAR-T cell products by gene editing presents the advantage of protecting CAR-T cells from PD1-induced exhaustion while sparing bystander T cells, thereby reducing the risk of autoimmune toxicities[73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R73),[74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R74). Another strategy to block this pathway is delivering a PD1 inhibitor by an ‘armoured’ CAR-T cell that secrets an immune checkpoint blockade single-chain variable fragment (scFv)[75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R75)-[77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R77). This strategy showed excellent results in preclinical syngeneic and xenogeneic mouse models of PDL1+ haematological malignancies[77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R77). Other elegant methods to inhibit PD1, such as introducing a dominant-negative PD1 extracellular domain or a novel PD1–CD28 chimeric switch receptor, have been developed in the context of immunotherapies for solid tumours[69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R69). The PD1–CD28 chimeric switch receptor containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the intracellular co-stimulatory molecule, CD28, serves two purposes: binding its ligand PDL1 and transmitting an activating signal instead of the inhibitory signal[78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R78). T cells carrying this construct showed superior activity against PDL1+ lymphoma cells ex vivo and in vivo than second-generation CD19 CAR-T cells. Of note, the authors describe a durable clinical response in one patient treated with this approach, without significant toxic effects[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R79).\n\nFinally, Lee et al.[80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R80) recently used a lentiviral two-in-one CAR construct. Two checkpoint receptors are downregulated simultaneously by a dual short hairpin RNA cassette integrated into a CAR vector. Using this system, the authors evaluated CD19-targeting CAR-T cells with four checkpoint combinations – PD1–TIM3, PD1–LAG3, PD1–CTLA4 and PD1–TIGIT – and found that downregulation of PD1 and TIGIT had unique synergistic antitumour effects. In the study, downregulation of PD1 enhanced the short-term effector function of CAR-T cells, whereas downregulation of TIGIT was responsible for maintaining a less-differentiated/exhausted state, providing a potential synergy. The efficacy and safety of PD1–TIGIT-downregulated CD19-targeting CAR-T cells are currently being evaluated in adult patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL ([NCT04836507](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04836507)). Many ongoing clinical trials have assessed the effects of immune checkpoint blockade in combination with CD19 CAR-T cells (such as [NCT04163302](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04163302)). The optimal timing and combination of checkpoint inhibition remain to be determined and could be surprising; for example, genetic knockout of PD1 in a clinical study of T cell receptor (TCR)-transduced T cells seemed to confer a disadvantage rather than increased persistence[81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R81).\n\n### Combination with small molecules\n\nA possible strategy to reduce T cell dysfunction is to combine CAR-T cells with small molecules that leverage T cell biology to enhance T cell activity. For instance, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib can enhance antitumour activity when combined with CD19 CAR-T cells[82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R82). Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a kinase downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR)[83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R83),[84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R84), and also targets IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK), a tyrosine kinase in T cells involved in modulating phospholipase Cγ, which is downstream of TCR signal transduction and is critical for T helper 2-type effector responses. Deletion or inhibition of ITK drives more T helper 1-type responses, and ibrutinib enhances CAR-T cell viability, proliferation, cytokine production and CAR-T cell engraftment in preclinical and clinical studies for patients with CLL[85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R85). In addition, patients with CLL who had been previously treated with ibrutinib for ≥6 months at the time of T cell collection showed improved ex vivo and in vivo CAR-T cell expansion, comparable with the T cell expansion of a healthy young donor, and this finding correlated positively with clinical response[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R86). In addition, when administered concurrently, ibrutinib exposure improved CAR-T cell engraftment, tumour clearance and survival in mouse models of resistant ALL and CLL xenografts[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R86). Similarly, results were obtained in preclinical models of CAR-T cells in mantle cell lymphoma[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R87). This approach was translated to the clinic by several groups. Gill et al.[88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R88) demonstrated superior T cell proliferation during the manufacturing of autologous CAR-T cells (targeted towards CD19 with a humanized binder) in patients with CLL who had received ibrutinib for >6 months but had persistent disease. In this prospective single-centre study ([NCT02640209](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02640209)), the authors reported the results of 18 patients with at least 15 months of follow-up[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R89). Of note, three of these patients were previously treated with murine scFv-bearing CD19 CAR-T cells but had progressed. At 12 months, 72% of patients tested had no minimal residual disease and the estimated overall and PFS at 48 months was 84% and 70%, respectively. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was frequent but mild–moderate and did not require therapy[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R89), and improved ex vivo T cell expansion was observed. This observation was in line with data from a clinical trial run at Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, which showed significant T cell proliferation in 5 of 16 patients with CLL who were receiving ibrutinib at the time of T cell collection and/or CAR-T cell administration[88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R88),[90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R90). Finally, Gauthier et al.[91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R91) showed that ibrutinib was well tolerated when initiated at 420 mg per day at least 2 weeks before leukapheresis and continued for at least 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion. Patients who received concurrent ibrutinib had a higher in vivo CAR-T cell number and lower CRS severity than patients who did not receive it (median CRS grade 1 versus 2, respectively; _P_ = 0.04). The authors found a higher proliferation index and a higher percentage of polyfunctional CAR-T cells (expressing ≥2 cytokines) and higher rates of patients with no minimal residual disease in the bone marrow as measured by multiparameter flow cytometry (72%) and by immunoglobulin heavy chain sequencing (85%) in patients receiving ibrutinib. It is not clear whether similar clinical results will be obtained with second-generation BTK inhibitors that are more specific for BTK and do not target ITK.\n\nAnother tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, has been used with a dual purpose in combination with CAR-T cell therapy. Dasatinib interferes with lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), preventing the phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP70 downstream of the TCR. This mechanism can increase the safety index of CAR-T cells by disrupting the downstream signalling cascade in CAR-T constructs harbouring either CD28–CD3ζ or 4-1BB–CD3ζ activation modules[92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R92). At a clinically achievable concentration (100 nM), dasatinib can switch off activated CAR-T cells to prevent cytotoxicity without compromising their viability; this ‘CAR-T paused state’ is reversible, and discontinuation of dasatinib restores CAR-T cell cytolytic activity, cytokine secretion and proliferation[93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R93). In mice engrafted with Nalm6 leukaemia cells engineered to express GD2, the introduction of dasatinib during treatment with GD2-targeting CAR-T cells (GD2.28ζ.FKBP) promoted a transient cessation of CAR signalling, mitigated exhaustion, promoted T cell memory during ex vivo expansion and enhanced CAR-T cell antitumour functionality in vivo[94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R94).\n\nThe PI3K–AKT pathway has a crucial role downstream of the TCR, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines receptors[95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R95). Inhibitors of PI3K–AKT enhance T cell central memory phenotype, reduce terminal differentiation and increase proliferation. Therefore, the use of AKT inhibitors has been explored to prolong CAR-T cell persistence. Preclinical studies showed that inhibition of AKT signalling during the CD19 CAR-T cell production resulted in T cells with superior antitumour activity in vitro and in vivo[96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R96). This approach was also effective during the manufacturing of anti-BCMA CAR-T cells. The use of IL-2 in combination with the PI3K inhibitor bb007 resulted in a CAR-T cell product (bb21217) enriched in memory-like T cells, reduced differentiation and improved expansion[97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R97),[98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R98). These data suggest that therapeutic modulation of PI3K–AKT might be a strategy to augment the antitumour efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy, which could transition to the clinic once AKT inhibitors are approved for clinical use.\n\nOverall, small molecules represent important tools for enhancing CAR-T function; however, the dosing, schedule and long-term effects require further testing in the clinic.\n\n### Allogeneic T cells\n\nCAR-T cells can be manufactured using T cells from healthy donors, offering several potential advantages over patient-derived T cells. First, healthy donors may provide a more functional T cell product and avoid T cell dysfunction[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R31),[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R99). In addition, this approach limits the risk of manufacturing failures, an issue occurring in 10–20% of CAR-T cell approval studies[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R1),[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R3), and reduces the time to infusion with banked and available off-the-shelf CAR-T cells. However, as with any allogeneic therapy (such as stem cell transplantation) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and CAR-T cell rejection are major hurdles to overcome. To avoid these complications, different strategies are in development. Gene editing, selection of specific subsets of T cells (γδ T cells or virus-specific T cells) or NK cells from healthy donors could evade GVHD[100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R100),[101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R101). In addition, allogeneic αβ T cells can be knocked out for the TCR α-chain constant gene (_TRAC_)[102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R102)-[104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R104). Additional gene editing or stealth strategies can be used to avoid host rejection of the therapeutic product. Examples include the use of CRISPR–Cas9 or other editing technologies to modify loci associated with the major histocompatibility class I complex (MHC-I). However, despite some promising preliminary data, overall results to date have not achieved the same level of efficacy as autologous products[104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R104),[105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R105).\n\nGene-edited allogeneic CAR-T cells targeting CD19, such as ‘UCART19’[106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R106), have shown some efficacy[105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R105). Seven children and 14 adults were treated as part of UCART19. Fourteen (67%) of the 21 patients had a complete response or a complete response with incomplete haematological recovery 28 days post-infusion. However, the patients who did not receive alemtuzumab (four patients) did not show UCART19 expansion. Three patients (14%) had grade 3–4 CRS. Additional adverse events included grade I acute skin graft disease in two patients (10%) and prolonged grade IV cytopenia in six patients (32%). Two treatment-related deaths were recorded; one patient developed neutropenic sepsis with concomitant CRS, and another patient developed pulmonary haemorrhage with persistent cytopenia.\n\nThus, although the development of alloreactions such as GVHD can be largely prevented, rejection of the allo-CAR-T is still a major barrier to achieving durable remissions. However, UCART19 may serve as a potential bridge-to-transplantation option.\n\nAvoiding the rejection of allogeneic therapeutic cell products requires preventing both T and NK cell responses that eliminate cells identified as foreign. A synthetic receptor, alloimmune defence receptor (ADR), which selectively recognizes 4-1BB expressed in activated T cells, has been developed[107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R107). ADR-expressing T cells target alloreactive lymphocytes while sparing quiescent lymphocytes, thereby resisting rejection. CAR-T cells engineered to express ADR demonstrated persistent tumour eradication in both liquid and solid in vivo tumour models, thus offering an off-the-shelf approach to generating rejection-resistant allogeneic T cell products. Other groups aim at rendering healthy donor T cells resistant to lymphodepleting agents, as intensified lymphodepletion may enable allogeneic CAR-T cells to increase expansion and antitumour activity before host immune recovery[108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R108)-[110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R110). Umbilical cord blood-derived T cells might serve as another T cell source aside from healthy donor T cells, reducing GVHD frequency owing to lower levels of released pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation[111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R111)-[113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R113). Other options such as immune effector cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells are also in early developmental stages[114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R114).\n\n### Non-T cell immune effector cells\n\nBuilding on the success of T cell therapies, adoptive cell therapy strategies have begun to include other immune effector cells or T cell subsets, such as NK cells, macrophages, γδ T cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells.\n\n#### NK cells.\n\nNK cells are cytotoxic cells with essential roles in the innate immune response against virus-infected or bacterium-infected and injured cells. Owing to their intrinsic properties, they offer potential as allogenic cellular immunotherapies because they do not recognize allogeneic antigens and do not cause GVHD. However, they are still susceptible to allogeneic rejection by the host immune system owing to the expression of MHC[115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R115). Activation of NK cells is regulated by a group of diverse transmembrane receptors, including activating, inhibitory, cytokine and chemokine receptors[115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R115). MHC downregulation, a common feature of tumour cells, provides an activation mechanism for NK cells that kills via the ‘missing-self’ mechanism. In addition, NK cells possess activating receptors such as NKG2D and activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) capable of recognizing ‘induced-self’ ligands preferentially expressed by cancer cells. Another potential advantage of NK cells relies on their killing mechanism that could be boosted by transduction with a CAR. CAR-NK cells can eliminate target cancer cells via CAR-dependent or CAR-independent mechanisms. Most CAR constructs used for NK cells share the same structure used in CAR-T cells, with a CD3ζ intracellular domain and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain to improve CAR-NK activation and cytokine production (such as IFNγ, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF))[115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R115),[116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R116). Other constructs have been designed using NK cell-specific co-stimulatory domains (DAP12 and 2B4) and may be superior to 4-1BB in terms of cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumour effect[117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R117).\n\nThe theoretical advantages of CAR-NK cells have led to considerable enthusiasm, with many clinical studies ongoing. As of this writing, at least 32 clinical trials have been planned or activated with CAR-NK cells, including 11 targeting acute leukaemias and 10 targeting lymphomas, and one product against multiple myeloma. Target antigens are CD19, CD22, CD19/CD22, CD33, BCMA and CD7 and are described in recent review articles[118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R118),[119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R119).\n\nNK cells derived from adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells are difficult to transduce, but NK cells are more amenable to gene engineering and can be obtained from umbilical cord blood, adult bone marrow CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells or inducible pluripotent stem cells. A phase I/II clinical trial in patients with NHL or CLL showed a complete response and sustained remission in patients treated with NK cells from cord blood transduced with anti-CD19 CAR and engineered to express IL-15 for improved persistence (the rimiducid-inducible caspase 9 suicide gene was included as a safety measure to trigger apoptosis in case of adverse events but was not triggered)[120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R120),[121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R121). Of the 11 patients, 8 patients responded to the therapy, 7 patients had complete remission and 1 patient had remission of the Richter’s transformation component but persistent CLL. Interestingly, NK cells persisted approximately 2 weeks after infusion, which has the potential advantage of limiting cytotoxicity in the case of on-target off-tumour effects. However, multiple infusions of CAR-NK cells are needed to achieve tumour clearance. It is important to note the limited number of patients in this trial, the fact that most responding patients received additional treatments after CAR-NK cells and the absence of long follow-up.\n\nSeveral differentiation protocols are now available to produce NK cells from inducible pluripotent stem cells[122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R122), a renewable source of NK cells that can be used as a platform for cloning and genome editing. They may lead to reduced manufacturing costs because they can be cryopreserved and administered to patients at different timings.\n\nAlthough CAR-NK cell therapy has some advantages over CAR-T cell therapy, important limitations also exist. NK cells are effective cytotoxic cells, but they can also become functionally exhausted in the TME, mainly because of hypoxia. Nonetheless, hypoxia can be used as an advantage when constructing CAR-NK cells. Juillerat et al.[123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R123) demonstrated that the incorporation of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) domain in the CAR construct could generate a system in which the expression of CAR is stimulated by low oxygen in the TME. In addition, CRISPR–Cas9 can be used to alter pathways that are involved in NK cell exhaustion or function, or counteract transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) immunosuppression[124](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R124),[125](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R125).\n\n#### Macrophages.\n\nMacrophages are a cellular component of the innate immune system. Macrophage cells can traffic to tumour cells, modulate the TME and present various antigens. Overcoming the immunosuppressive TME and negative immunomodulatory signals is one of the main challenges faced by CAR-T cells[126](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R126). CAR-macrophages have thus emerged as a possible alternative tool, especially against solid tumours, owing to their ability to infiltrate the TME and modulate the immune response[127](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R127). A crucial challenge when generating macrophage-based immunotherapies is enabling their pro-inflammatory effects[127](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R127). CAR-macrophages designed to recognize CD19, HER2 or mesothelin with a CD8 transmembrane and CD3ζ intracellular domain efficiently redirected macrophages towards an M1 phenotype, stimulating antigen-dependent phagocytosis, cytokine release and antitumour activity[128](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R128). Morrissey et al.[129](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R129) engineered a family of CARs for phagocytosis that direct macrophages to engulf specific antigen-coated particles (CD19 and CD22) and tested a panel of intracellular domains. Because macrophages evolved to detect and respond to exogenous nucleic acids and present limited proliferative capacity, the delivery of the CAR construct is challenging. Klichinsky et al.[128](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R128) used the elegant replication-deficient chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5f35 to deliver the CAR. This system transduced the macrophages with high efficiency and reproducibility and resulted in M1 differentiation, thus creating a pro-inflammatory TME and synergizing with the CAR activity.\n\nSeveral clinical trials are ongoing evaluating CAR-macrophages for solid cancers ([NCT04660929](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04660929)).\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Tumour-intrinsic resistance\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Antigen escape\n\nAntigen-negative escape has been observed since the early clinical trials of second-generation CAR-T cells. Extensive data on the incidence of CD19 loss are available and more data are emerging for BCMA and CD22 loss. Antigen loss can be a consequence of several mechanisms, including lineage switching, alternative splicing, frameshift or gene deletions, abnormal processing or trafficking of the antigen, or epitope masking. The altered clone is probably a pre-existing clone that has a survival advantage under the strong selective pressure of CAR-T cells.\n\n#### CD19.\n\nThe loss of expression of the CD19 protein on cancer cells can occur as a mechanism of immune escape to CD19-targeted therapies. Antigen-negative disease relapse following CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has been described primarily in patients with B-ALL, with some recent data confirming it in NHL cases. The incidence of CD19 loss after CAR-T cell therapy varies between B-ALL and NHL and between paediatric versus adult cases.\n\nClinical data from paediatric trials described 18–24% of cases (13 out of 55 patients) with initial complete responses developing CD19− relapse[130](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R130)-[132](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R132). In patients with axi-cel and tisa-cel, CD19 escape was seen in 9–25% in B-ALL and 27–35% in DLBCL[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R15),[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R133)-[135](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R135). Longer CAR-T cell persistence is typically associated with a decreased overall risk of relapse but an increased rate of antigen loss as a mechanism of relapse. When anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy was used as a ‘bridge to allo-HSCT’ in B-ALL cases, none of the patients who received a transplant developed antigen escape relapse, whereas antigen-negative B-ALL was observed in cases that were not eligible for transplant[136](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R136). In NHL, in a combined analysis of phase I and phase II trials of axi-cel, 3 out of 11 patients (27%) who progressed after a response had CD19 loss as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R2). A study from Spiegel et al.[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R137) evaluated resistance to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in NHL and its association with low levels or loss of CD19 at relapse, using the semiquantitative IHC H-score to measure CD19 expression at baseline and at disease progression in patients treated with axi-cel. Among patients with paired pre-therapy and post-therapy H-scores, 60% (9 patients out of 15) who expressed CD19 showed an expression loss of CD19 at relapse. Still, a pretreatment semiquantitative IHC measurement of CD19 expression did not identify patients at risk of relapse. In the ZUMA-2 trial, Wang and colleagues[138](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R138) reported 23% relapses among 60 patients with mantle cell lymphoma, with only one case (7%) having undetectable CD19 (ref. 5). In the ZUMA-5 trial for patients with follicular lymphoma, none of the patients had a loss of CD19 expression at disease progression. Overall, CD19 loss seems to occur more frequently when the tumour arises from more immature B cells.\n\nCD19 loss can occur through various mechanisms, including genetic alterations, such as CD19 gene mutations or deletions, or epigenetic modifications that lead to silencing of the _CD19_ gene expression. Sotillo and colleagues[139](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R139) at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia were, to our knowledge, the first to describe CD19 mutations and splice variants in B-ALL paediatric cases that had relapsed after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. The study compared four samples before and after CD19 CAR-T cell treatment and detected CD19 splice variants involving exon 2 (Aexon2) or exons 5–6 skipping in relapsed leukaemias[139](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R139). A more recent analysis with a different algorithm also highlighted intron 2 retention, which would cause either nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript or a truncated CD19 protein. Splice variants involving Δexon2 variants have also been reported by Fischer and colleagues[140](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R140), and this analysis also confirmed the existence of alternative CD19 spliced isoforms at the disease diagnosis. Δexon2 variants are unable to fold correctly and traffic to the cell surface and are retained by the endoplasmic reticulum[141](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R141). Under selective CD19 CAR-T cell pressure, cells carrying those variants could evolve as a dominant clone. Single-cell RNA sequencing has confirmed that CD19− B-ALL cells can exist before CAR-T cell therapy[142](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R142).\n\nAn analysis of specimens collected at enrolment and at the time of clinical relapse from two phase II CD19 CAR-T cell trials of paediatric and young adult patients showed that 12 out of 17 patients analysed had CD19− relapse. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified frameshift mutations throughout exons 2–5 of _CD19_ in all 12 specimens, predictive of a truncated protein lacking membrane anchorage[134](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R134). In a recent report, three patients with CD19− relapsed DLBCL after CD19 CAR-T therapy carried mutations in CD19 exon 3, highlighting the first exons of _CD19_ as a possible mutational hotspot[143](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R143). Braig et al.[144](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R144) observed that one out of four patients with B-ALL who developed CD19− relapse after treatment with the CD19–CD3 bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) blinatumomab had no mutations in _CD19_ and expressed full-length _CD19_ mRNA but had no expression of CD81. CD81 associates with CD19 in the endoplasmic reticulum and is critical for the transport of CD19 to the cell surface. Therefore, CD19− immune escape had resulted from a lack of CD81 expression and subsequent defective transport and/or maturation of CD19 in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi[144](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R144). Moreover, the expression of the Golgi-resident intramembrane protease signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) in malignant B cells has recently been identified as a potent regulator of resistance to CAR-T cell therapy[145](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R145). A loss of SPPL3 leads to hyperglycosylation of CD19, suppressing CAR-T cell effector function and cytotoxicity, whereas overexpression of SPPL3 induces a loss of the CD19 protein and thus resistance to CAR-T cells. Another mechanism appearing as antigen loss is lineage switching, particularly in tumours originating from highly immature cells, such as pre-B cell ALL or mixed-lineage-rearranged leukaemia. The phenomenon was described initially in paediatric patients with B-ALL who relapsed after chemotherapy, and it was recently observed after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy or after blinatumomab treatment. Anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy imposes a selective pressure on B-ALL leukaemia expressing CD19 and leads to an outgrowth of tumours expressing markers of a different lineage (from lymphoid to myeloid blasts), including a loss of the target antigen CD19. Gardner et al.[131](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R131) found that two out of seven patients with B-ALL with a rearrangement in histone-lysine _N_-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) developed acute myeloid leukaemia at the time of relapse after anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. Jacoby et al.[146](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R146) showed a similar interesting result, in which an infant with KMT2A-rearrangement ALL treated with CD19 CAR-T cells showed initial clearance of blasts followed by disease relapse with the expression of CD34, CD11b and CD33, of which all are myeloid markers. The TME may also play a part in lineage determination, suggesting that a combination of the oncogenic driver with environmental cues can contribute to pressuring lineage switch[147](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R147). Finally, Ruella and colleagues[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R56) described a case of epitope masking in a paediatric patient with ALL who relapsed 9 months after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. Although it initially seemed to be CD19− by flow cytometry, a deeper analysis of the leukaemic blasts showed that CD19 was in fact expressed but bound in _cis_ to the CD19 CAR that was aberrantly expressed in leukaemic blasts. The aberrant expression of the CAR in the leukaemic blasts was due to the accidental transduction of a single leukaemic cell during manufacturing[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R56).\n\n#### CD22.\n\nCD22 is a cell-surface molecule that, like CD19, is broadly and uniquely expressed by B-lineage cells[148](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R148),[149](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R149). Interestingly, downregulation of CD22 seems to be the major mechanism of escape following anti-CD22 CAR-T cell therapy, probably related to the relative lower efficacy of CD22 CAR-T and the tendency of CD22 to be internalized. CD22-directed CAR-T cells have been investigated in paediatric and adult patients with relapse or refractory (R/R) B-ALL as well as in adult NHL after failure of CD19 CAR-T cell therapy[150](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R150),[151](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R151). In a single-institution phase I dose-escalation trial, three patients with LBCL and six patients with ALL received CD22 CAR-T cell therapy after a median of six previous lines of treatment, including previous CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy. All patients with LBCL achieved complete response with a median follow-up of 8.4 months, and all patients with ALL achieved a complete response with a median of 5.1 months[151](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R151). The LBCL cohort was recently updated, with 36 patients (median follow-up 15.7 months) achieving objective and complete response rates of 72% and 53%, respectively[152](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R152). Shah et al.[148](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R148) conducted a single-centre, phase I trial in 58 patients with R/R CD22+ malignancies, including 56 B-ALL and one DLBCL. In this cohort, 87.9% of patients had received previous CD19-directed therapy. The complete remission rate was 70%. The median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% CI of 7.7–20.3 months). Among those patients who achieved a complete response, the median relapse-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI of 4.1–6.5 months). Of note, 86.2% experienced CRS, but only 10% were grade 3 or above. Interestingly, approximately 32.8% of participants exhibited haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like manifestations requiring the use of anakinra (cytokine blockade targeting IL-1) and high-dose steroids. This clinical trial highlighted the importance of antigen density in response to CD22 CAR-T cells. In another study, treatment with CD22-targeted CAR-T cells in 21 children and adults, including 17 patients previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy, showed dose-dependent antileukaemic activity, with complete remission obtained in 73% (11 of 15) of patients, including all patients with CD19 low or CD19− B-ALL[149](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R149). In this study, relapses were associated with diminished CD22 density, without gene mutations or alteration in the mRNA levels, indicating a post-translational mechanism of CD22 expression to the cell surface. Lower CD22 protein levels can enable tumour cell escape from CD22 CAR-T-mediated killing. To our knowledge, this was the first study in which a direct correlation between CD22 levels and CAR-T cell-mediated killing was proven in vivo and in vitro by generating leukaemia lines with variable CD22 expression levels and directly demonstrating that tumour control in xenograft models was dependent on surface expression levels of CD22. The inability of CAR molecules to bind to low levels of antigens might derive from differences between the endogenous TCR and the CAR and/or differences at the immunological synapse. Natural TCRs evolved to recognize antigens at low density and contain several intracellular signalling domains. CAR molecules typically incorporate only the gene encoding the TCRζ chain and, during the course of antigen recognition, they form an immunological synapse that is differently organized compared with that of a natural TCR[153](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R153),[154](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R154). Results from a different phase Ib trial showed that CD22-targeting CAR-T cells have a good safety profile and resulted in high rates of complete response and no minimal residual disease in 18 adults and children, independent of previous treatment with CD19 CAR-T cells, blinatumomab or inotuzumab[155](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R155).\n\n#### BCMA.\n\nAntigen escape has been documented in patients with multiple myeloma treated with CAR-T cells targeting BCMA. Two studies have shown that BCMA can be lost or significatively reduced at relapse. Ali et al.[156](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R156) reported that 8% (1 in 12 patients) of targeted-treated patients exhibited a BCMA− biopsy. In another cohort, 67% of patients (12 of 18) with evaluable biopsy pretreatment and post-treatment with BCMA CAR-T cells showed a reduction in BCMA intensity on myeloma cells, including 4 out of 9 non-responders[157](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R157). A total of 1 out of 16 patients with an evaluable bone marrow sample at relapse experienced antigen loss in the idecabtagene vicleucel approval study[158](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R158). Further isolated cases of downregulation or loss of BCMA have been observed in patients who relapsed after CAR-T cell therapy[159](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R159)-[161](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R161). Overall, however, antigen escape associated with anti-BCMA therapies does not seem to be as common as with CD19-targeting CAR-T cells, probably because BCMA is essential for plasma cell survival[158](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R158).\n\n### Antigen-positive tumour escape\n\nOutside B-ALL, most of the relapses after CAR-T cell therapy are characterized by the continued presence of the target antigen. Typically, these relapses occur earlier than the antigen-negative ones and are thought to be linked to poor CAR-T cell persistence or function. Recent data in B-ALL revealed that decreased expression of death receptor signalling molecules, such as components of the FAS pathway, or pro-apoptotic mediators of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis constitute a novel mechanism of primary resistance to CAR-T cell therapy[162](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R162). Through an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 loss-of-function screen, the authors identified progressive impairment in CAR-T cell function initially driven by downregulation of the FAS-associated protein with death domain (FADD). Together, these results suggested that disruption of the death receptor signalling pathway leads to decreased tumour killing and persistent antigen exposure that, in turn, results in global transcriptomic and epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-T cells, adversely affecting their function. The findings were further validated using samples from two clinical trials in which the leukaemic cells in non-responders had a significantly lower death receptor signature expression than responders. A more recent report added that hypermethylation of DNA, a stem cell-like phenotype and inherent plasticity, and decreased antigen presentation are features of leukaemia cells that do not respond to CAR-T cell therapy[163](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R163).\n\nA better understanding of how T cells eliminate tumours is essential to unravel resistance mechanisms. Using a CRISPR–Cas9 screen, one group found that activation of FAS mediated bystander killing of antigen-negative tumour cells, thereby increasing the clearance of antigen-heterogeneous tumours[164](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R164). In addition, in a large clinical study, FAS expression in tumour cells was able to predict the survival of patients treated with CAR-T cells ([NCT02348216](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02348216)) and can thus contribute to further understanding of CAR-T cell response[164](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R164). Other clinical studies focused on antigen-positive escaped are displayed in [Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#T2).\n\n#### Table 2 ∣.\n\nClinical trials that address antigen-positive escape (excluding T cell dysfunction)\n\n| [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) identifier | Country | Disease | Construct |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [NCT03331198](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03331198) | USA | R/R CLL or SLL | JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel) + venetoclax |\n| [NCT03310619](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03310619) | USA | Aggressive B cell NHL | JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel) + ibrutinib |\n| [NCT04234061](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04234061) (ref.

In a recent study, adult patients with R/R ALL received two autologous CAR-T cell products (one targeting CD19 (huCAR T19) and the other targeting CD22 (CAR T22-65s)). All evaluable patients (_n_ = 11) achieved a complete response with no minimal residual disease, despite previous treatment with CD19-targeting and/or CD22-targeting immunotherapy[167](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R167). Similar approaches have been conducted by other groups[168](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R168),[169](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R169). The limitations of this approach are the cost and effort to produce two different vectors and two different products and the related regulatory challenges.\n\n#### Co-transduction or bicistronic CAR vectors.\n\nThis approach uses a single T cell product to express two CARs that recognize different antigens. This can be achieved by different approaches. T cells can be co-transduced with two different vectors to create a T cell product with a mixed population, in which some of the cells are transduced with one or both vectors. An alternative strategy uses bicistronic vectors that enable the co-expression of two different CAR molecules on the same T cell. A recent study documented dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 against B-ALL by using a novel anti-CD22 CAR construct able to recognize cells with low CD22 density and lacking tonic signalling[170](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R170). CAR-T cells in the study were co-transduced with two separate vectors: anti-CD22 CAR (9A8-41BBζ) and anti-CD19 CAR (CAT-41BBζ). The obtained CAR-T cell product (CAT/9A8) eliminated single-positive and double-positive target cells in vitro and in vivo. CAT/9A8 CAR-T cells are now being tested in a phase I clinical study ([NCT02443831](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02443831))[170](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R170). In addition, Cordoba et al.[171](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R171) conducted a phase I trial in paediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL to test AUTO3 (autologous transduced T cells expressing both anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs with a bicistronic vector encoding both CARs) ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#T3)). In the trial, 13 of 15 treated patients responded to the treatment, regardless of disease burden, cytogenetic risk factors or the number of previous lines of therapy, including one case with CD19− CD22+ blasts before lymphodepletion, reinforcing the importance of dual targeting. Strategies to optimize the persistence of this dual-targeting product are needed because nine patients ultimately relapsed with low CAR-T cell persistence. The reason for reduced persistence is not fully understood, but it was also observed in other trials with a mixed anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 infusion product or dual CAR-T cells[172](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R172),[173](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R173). Roddie at al.[174](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R174) evaluated dual targeting by using AUTO3 CAR-T cells in combination with PD1 blockade (pembrolizomab) in R/R LBLC and reported it to be safe and suitable for outpatient administration. This treatment approach resulted in lasting remissions in 54.4% of patients who achieved a complete response, accompanied by strong expansion of CAR-T cells. However, both the dual-targeting CAR-T therapy and pembrolizumab failed to prevent relapse in a significant number of patients. Fousek et al. recently reported CD19/20/22-targeting CAR-T cells by co-expressing individual CAR molecules on a single T cell by using one tricistronic transgene. CD19/20/22 CAR-T cells killed CD19− blasts from patients who relapsed after anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. These triple-targeting CAR-T cells formed dense immune synapses with target cells, mediated effective cytolytic complex formation and were as efficacious as CD19 CAR-T cells against primary CD19+ disease[175](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R175).\n\n##### Table 3 ∣.\n\nClinical trials that address antigen-negative escape mechanisms\n\n| [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) identifier | Country | Disease | Product | Observations | Refs. |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| **CD19/CD20** |\n| [NCT03019055](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03019055) | USA | R/R B cell malignancies | Anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 tandem receptor | ORR 100%; CR 92%; PR 8% for doses of 2.5 × 10 6 cells per kg with non-cryopreserved infusion (_n_ = 12) | [178](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R178) |\n| [NCT03097770](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03097770) | China | R/R BCL | Anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 tandem receptor | Best ORR 78% (95% CI 68–86); CR 70% (95% CI 59–79); PR 8% (95% CI 3–16) (_n_ = 87) | [218](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R218),[219](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R219) |\n| [NCT03207178](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03207178) | China | R/R BCL | Co-administration of anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 | OS 8.1 month and PFS 5.0 months | [220](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R220) |\n| [NCT04007029](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04007029) | USA | R/R FL, DLBCL, MCL and CLL/SLL | CD19–CD20 bispecific CAR | CR 7 of 8 of patients, median follow-up of 12 months; median PFS and OS were not reached | [221](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R221) |\n| **CD19/CD22** |\n| [NCT03620058](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03620058) | USA | R/R B-ALL | CART22-65s with huCART19 | Relapse rate: 1/11 at a median follow-up of 6 months | [167](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R167) |\n| [NCT03233854](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03233854) | USA | R/R B cell malignancies | CD19-22.BB.z | LBCL: _n_ = 21, best ORR 62% (95% CI 38–82%); CR 29% (95% CI 11–52%) B-ALL: all patients had a response (_n_ = 17); 14 with CR (82%) and 3 with partial remission | [137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R137) |\n| AMELIA trial, EUDRA CT 2016-004680-39 | UK | Paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL | AUTO3, autologous transduced T cells expressing both anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs | At 1 month after treatment, the remission rate (CR or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery) was 86% (13 of 15 patients).

On the basis of clear evidence that both CD19 antigen loss following CD19-directed immunotherapy and diminished CD22 cell-surface expression contribute to relapse, the group of Fry[176](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R176) designed a bispecific anti-CD19–CD22 CAR (CD19-22. BB.z-CAR) that simultaneously targets both antigens and preserved bifunctionality against both CD19 and CD22. This loop CD19–CD22 CAR showed strong preclinical data of efficient killing of CD19+CD22+, CD19+CD22− and CD19− CD22+ B-ALL tumours in xenograft models[176](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R176). This bispecific CAR has progressed to phase I clinical trials for both children and adults with R/R B-ALL ([NCT03241940](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03241940)) and R/R CD19+ DLBCL ([NCT03233854](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03233854)) and children and young adult patients with R/R CD19+CD22+ B cell malignancies ([NCT03448393](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03448393))[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R137),[177](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R177). Spiegel et al.[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R137) used CD19-22.BB.z-CAR in a phase I clinical trial ([NCT03233854](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03233854)) of adults with R/R B-ALL or LBCL and observed that relapses were CD19−/low in 50% of B-ALL patients and in approximately 30% of patients with LBCL but never associated with CD22 antigen loss or low expression, suggesting that selective pressure on the CD22 antigen was lower than when CD22 alone was targeted. Further studies are needed to calibrate and tune different CAR potencies when used in combination[137](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R137). The construct has also been used in a dose-escalation phase I clinical trial in treated children and young adults heavily pretreated with B-ALL, showing only limited CAR-T cell expansion and cytokine production and prompting further construct optimization[177](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R177). A tandem bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and CD20 is currently being tested in a phase I trial in patients with R/R B cell malignancies (NHL and CLL; [NCT03019055](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03019055))[178](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R178). This product is manufactured and infused without cryopreservation. The overall response rate to the dose of 2.5 × 10 6 cells per kg with non-cryopreserved infusion (_n_ = 12) was 100% (complete response of 92%; partial response of 8%). Several clinical trials are underway to test multiple-targeting CAR-T cells and to overcome antigen loss or downregulation ([Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#T3)). One interesting consideration about this trial is that it showed no correlation between initial levels of expression of CD19 and CD20 and clinical response. In addition, the trial reported that only one patient out of the five patients who entered the trial after receiving anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy achieved adequate CAR-T cell expansion and a complete response, suggesting that retreatment with a pure based immunotherapy approach remains challenging. Long-term follow-up ([NCT03375619](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03375619)) continues. Ruella et al.[179](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R179) also tested the novel combination of anti-IL-3 receptor-α chain (CD123) CAR and anti-CD19 CAR in B-ALL models after observing that CD123 was expressed in relapsed CD19 B-ALL disease. Anti-CD123 CAR-T cells targeted antigen-negative blasts and could be co-administered with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells to prevent antigen-loss relapse. A novel tandem CAR construct that combined CD19-mediated and CD123-mediated T cell activation provided superior in vivo activity against B-ALL than single antigen-expressing CAR-T cells or pooled combination CAR-T cells.\n\n### Fourth-generation CAR-T cells\n\nFourth-generation CAR-T cells are engineered to secrete additional molecules, such as cytokines, to enhance antitumour activity. As a result, in addition to the direct antitumour attack, they can trigger T cells to eliminate antigen-negative cancer cells at the target site. These T cells are also referred to as T cells redirected for universal cytokine-mediated killing (TRUCKs). Some of these TRUCKs secrete IL-12 or IL-18, and their improved antitumour effects have been demonstrated in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models[180](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R180),[181](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R181).\n\nA different approach is the design of CAR-T cells with the secretion of bispecific antibodies. They can target different tumour antigens and also recruit T cells to the TME. Therefore, the combination of these two strategies can reduce antigen escape and heterogeneity, as well as increase overall antitumour activity and CAR persistence. For the treatment of glioblastoma, a recent study incorporated this idea by evaluating a bicistronic construct that expresses a CAR specific for EGFRvIII – a mutant form of EGFR mostly expressed in glioblastoma – and a bispecific T cell engager against EGFR, which is overexpressed in glioblastoma[182](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R182). In contrast to EGFRvIII CAR-T cell monotherapy, the combination CAR and the bispecific T cell engager eliminated the heterogeneous tumour in a glioblastoma mouse model with a good safety profile. Dual application of CAR-T cells and BiTEs separately can also be successful, as shown in a case study that reported increased CAR-T cell expansion of CD22 CAR-T cells after treatment with blinatumomab, in a patient with R/R B-ALL who had relapsed after CAR-T cell monotherapy[183](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R183).\n\n### Combination strategies\n\nCombining CAR-T cells with treatments that maintain target expression on the tumour surface is also a potential strategy to prevent antigen downregulation. BCMA is actively cleaved from the tumour cell surface by γ-secretase, resulting in decreased ligand density. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretases can block BCMA cleavage[184](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R184),[185](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R185). This strategy has proven to be successful when a combination of γ-secretase inhibitors and BCMA CAR-T cells was tested in murine models of multiple myeloma[185](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R185). Studies assessing γ-secretase inhibition with concurrent BCMA CAR-T cell treatment are underway ([NCT03502577](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03502577), [NCT04714827](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04714827) and [NCT04162353](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04162353))[186](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R186),[187](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R187).\n\nAn alternative strategy in the setting oflow antigen density is to modify the design of the CAR molecule to tune the threshold for CAR-T cell activation. An exciting strategy explored by Majzner et al.[188](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R188) is based on including additional immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CAR to improve the recognition of low antigen density. This strategy was further enhanced when combined with the CD28 hinge transmembrane region, proving that the precise design of CARs can tune the threshold for antigen recognition.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Immunosuppressive TME\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe TME has a crucial role in terms of response to cancer treatment, as it can attenuate the effectiveness of the infused CAR-T cells through several mechanisms, including the physical barrier, soluble factors and immunosuppressive cells[189](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R189).\n\n### Mechanisms of TME immune suppression\n\nThe TME can pose challenges to effective CAR-T cell therapy by reducing trafficking and inducing T cell dysfunction[190](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R190),[191](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R191). Immune dysregulation in DLBCL treated with axi-cel showed that resistance to the CAR-T cell therapy centred on circulating mononuclear MDSCs and tumour IFN signalling, which led to insufficient axi-cel expansion as well as elevated expression of immune checkpoint ligands[192](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R192). Although acute exposure to IFNγ increases the antitumour function of immune cells, chronic signalling can lead to immune suppression with resistance to therapeutic methods such as immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The importance of IFNγ for host immune activation of CD19-targeted CAR-T cells in the TME has been demonstrated in an immunocompetent mouse lymphoma model[193](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R193). Therefore, IFNγ may have reduced immunosuppression in the TME through checkpoint inhibition or cytokine regulation, influencing the effectiveness of CAR-T cells[194](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R194),[195](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R195). However, recent work indicated that the loss of genes (IFNγ receptor 1 (_IFNGR1_) and Janus kinase 1 (_JAK1_) and _JAK2_) in the IFNγ receptor signalling pathway conferred resistance to CAR-T cell killing only in solid tumours but did not affect lymphoma or leukaemia cell sensitivity to CAR-T cells[196](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R196),[197](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R197). In addition, a recent study investigating the mechanisms of action of axi-cel discovered that all important aspects of successful CAR application (efficacy and patients survival as well as lack of toxicity) were linked to the pretreatment and post-treatment tumour immune contexture[198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R198) – a concept that includes a summary of various parameters of the immune system and a more precise characterization and localization of immune cells within a tumour[199](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R199). Also, the study confirmed the important role of the TME as a powerful resistance mechanism alongside T cell dysfunction and antigen escape.\n\nImportantly, the TME can vary in the different disease types targeted by currently approved CAR-T cell therapy (mainly DLBCL, ALL and myeloma) owing to differences in the disease itself as well as the different anatomical sites such as lymph nodes or bone marrow[200](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R200)-[202](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R202). In B cell NHL, the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME can render CAR-T cells unable to sufficiently attack the tumour. In one report, patients achieving complete responses had decreased levels of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T (T reg) cells and MDSCs, whereas chemokines and MDSCs were overexpressed in patients achieving only a partial remission[203](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R203). Additional studies are necessary to provide a deeper understanding of the contribution of the TME towards CAR-T cell-targeted haematological malignancies.\n\n### Overcoming TME immunosuppression\n\nAltering and modifying the TME through various strategies, such as directly targeting TAMs and other immunosuppressive factors, has potential to improve the clinical efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy and achieve more durable remissions. The immunosuppressive influence of the TME can be reduced in different ways ([Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#T4)). TRUCKs, discussed in the previous section, are one potential strategy. Various cytokines can be incorporated, such as IL-7, which selectively expands tumour-redirected cytotoxic T lymphocytes independently of T reg cells, or IL-15, which increases T cell expansion after antigen recognition and can simultaneously increase the cytotoxicity of tumours[204](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R204),[205](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R205). Similarly, secretion of IL-12 or IL-18 can induce a pro-inflammatory remodelling of the TME[180](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R180),[181](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R181),[206](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R206)-[208](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R208).\n\n#### Table 4 ∣.\n\nClinical trials that address tumour microenvironment resistance mechanisms\n\n| [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) identifier | Country | Disease | Product | Results | Ref. |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| [NCT04684563](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04684563) | USA | CLL and NHL | huCART19-IL18 | Dose-escalation study aimed to investigate the MTD of the therapy as well as other outcomes such as safety, PK and efficacy | NA |\n| [NCT03602157](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03602157) | USA | R/R CD30+ HL and CTCL | Autologous T lymphocyte CAR cells targeted against the CD30 antigen with CCR4 (ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4) | 8 Patients with HL have responded, with 6 CR (75%) and 2 PR; median PFS for all 10 evaluable patients is5.2 months at 12.7 months; median OS has not been reached | [224](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R224) |\n| [NCT04099797](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04099797) | USA | GD2-expressing brain tumours | GD2-specific chimeric antigen and constitutively active IL-7 receptors | NA | NA |\n| [NCT03089203](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03089203) | USA | Castrate-resistant prostate cancer | Dual PSMA-specific/TGFβ-resistant CAR-modified autologous T cells (CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells) | Preliminary evidence for early antitumour function was observed in this trial, including a PSA decline in approximately 30% of treated patients, although PSA responses were of limited durability | NA |\n| [NCT04556669](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04556669) | China | Cervical cancer sarcoma, NSCLC | Autologous anti-PDL1 armoured anti-CD22 CAR-T cells | NA | NA |\n| [NCT03196830](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03196830) | China | R/R lymphoma | Anti-CD30 CAR-T cell treatment combined with an PD1 inhibitor | PFS and OS rates were 45% and 70%, respectively; median follow-up of 21.5 months | [225](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R225) |\n| [NCT04844086](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04844086) | Taiwan | Advanced lymphoid malignancies | Rapid personalized manufacturing of CD19 mbIL-15 CAR-T cells | Phase I, open-label dose-escalation trial, evaluation of safety and tolerability | NA |\n| [NCT03579927](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03579927) | USA | BCL and CLL | CD19-CD28ζ-2A-iCasp9-IL15-transduced cord blood natural killer cells when given together with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant | Of the 11 patients who were treated, 8 (73%) had a response; of these patients, 7 (4 with lymphoma and 3 with CLL) had a complete remission, and 1 had remission of the Richter’s transformation component but had persistent CLL | [120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R120) |\n| [NCT05032820](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05032820) and [NCT03070327](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03070327) | USA | MM | Anti-BCMA CAR-T cells (bb2121) and lenalidomide | NA | NA |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/table/T4/)\n\nBCL, B cell lymphoma; BCMA, B cell maturation antigen; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; CR, complete response; CTCL, cutaneous T cell lymphoma; HL, Hodgkin lymphoma; MM, multiple myeloma; MTD, maximum tolerated dose; NA, not applicable; NHL, non-HL; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung cancer; OS, overall survival; PD1, programmed cell death 1; PDL1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; PFS, progression-free survival; PK, pharmacokinetics; PR, partial response; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; PSMA, prostate-specific membrane antigen; R/R, relapsed or refractory; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β.\n\nCAR-T cells can also be combined with BiTE, which can activate T reg cells to degranulate and kill target cells via perforin release. Another possibility is to incorporate synthetic enzyme-armed NK cells with attached inactive prodrugs, programmed to be activated directly at the tumour site and resulting in increased activity against the target tumour[209](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R209). The TME can also be influenced by the co-stimulatory signalling domain of a CAR. The CD28 co-stimulatory domain supports T reg cell persistence through IL-2 secretion. However, the deletion of the LCK-binding moiety of the CD28 endodomain can abolish IL-2 secretion and drastically reduce the number of T reg cells at the tumour site. In addition, removal of this domain does not negatively affect CAR-T cell functionality or IFNγ secretion[210](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R210). Another potential way to circumvent the immunosuppressive nature of the TME is using Toll-like receptor agonists. These compounds can increase the recruitment of leukocytes, particularly both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and T helper cells, to the tumour site and thereby reduce the suppressive TME influence[211](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R211),[212](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R212). Outside the current B cell disorders for which CAR-T cells are approved, patients with treatment-resistant Hodgkin lymphoma may benefit from CAR-T cell therapy but lack the CD19 antigen, and the TME is very immunosuppressive[213](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R213). In addition, in vitro, Hodgkin lymphoma cells convert macrophages into TAMs, which can severely limit CAR-T cell proliferation. However, anti-CD123 CAR-T cells actively attack TAMs as well as Hodgkin tumour cells and establish long-term immune memory.\n\nSmith et al.[214](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R214) published a study on the clinical role of the gut microbiota in CAR-T cells (including both 4-1BB and CD28 products) in patients with R/R B-ALL and LBCL. Exposure to antibiotics, such as piperacillin–tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem, during the 4 weeks before CAR-T cell administration was associated with decreased faecal microbiome diversity and overall survival. Also, a higher rate of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed in the lymphoma subcohort when antibiotics were administered before CAR-T cell infusion. Conversely, a high frequency of obligate anaerobes such as _Ruminococcus_, _Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium_ and _Akkermansia_ was associated with a complete response by day 100. Stein-Thoeringer et al.[215](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R215) confirmed these data with a cohort of patients with NHL in the USA and Germany who received axi-cel, tisa-cel or liso-cel infusion. _Bifidobacterium longum_ and peptidoglycan biosynthesis highly correlated with long-term survival and response to CAR-T cells, independent of demographic or clinical variables. _Lachnospira pectinoschiza_ and _Akkermansia muciniphila_ significantly associated with CD3+ and CD4+ T cell counts at the time of T cell apheresis, whereas _Bacteroides_, _Blautia_ and _Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_ had a negative effect on CD3+ and CD8+ T cell levels. Finally, the authors highlighted that _Akkermansia_ may be involved in the better quality and performance of the manufactured T cell product. However, both studies did not report any association between the composition of the gut microbiota and CRS.\n\nAside from the TME itself, other host factors could probably influence CAR-T cell therapy. A recent study found that changes in the intestinal microbiome are associated with clinical outcomes in patients receiving CD19 CAR-T cells for a B cell malignancy[214](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R214). Further evaluation is necessary to investigate the role of the microbiome with regard to resistance to CAR therapy.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Future perspectives\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, CAR-T cells have transformed the landscape of treatment for lymphoid malignancies, producing unprecedented response rates in patients with otherwise poor prognosis, and successfully moving up to earlier lines of treatment. However, resistance to CAR-T cells remains a key obstacle to the long-term and far-reaching therapeutic success of this therapy and thus is an important area of laboratory and clinical research[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R53),[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R133),[165](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/#R165). Unlike most cancer therapeutics, in the case of CAR-T cells, potential mechanisms of resistance include failure of the drug itself (dysfunction, exhaustion and lack of persistence) and susceptibility of the drug to other host factors (TME, microbiome and previous therapies), in addition to tumour-related factors that apply to all therapeutic agents (aggressive disease, target loss and primary resistance to cell death pathways). However, unlike small molecules or protein-based biologics, CAR-T cells offer unique opportunities to engineer the therapeutic agent to enable improved products that overcome multiple potential resistance mechanisms, whether they are product related or tumour related. A thorough understanding of how CAR-T cells kill tumour cells and of the different mechanisms of resistance is essential for the further development of the next generation of immunotherapies. Promising strategies that are being developed include CAR-T cells that can target multiple antigens to reduce antigen escape, armoured CARs that release proteins for additional antitumour efficacy, optimization of CAR signalling to improve clinical efficacy, the combination of CAR-T with small molecules and in general the use of genetic engineering to enhance CAR-T cell functions.\n\nChallenges for the field include the development of representative preclinical models that can recapitulate primary and secondary resistance, whether they are related to the therapeutic agent, the tumour or other host factors. Current mouse models, for example, usually do not represent the TME well, and if they do, compromises have to be made elsewhere, such as the inability to test human T cells in syngeneic models or the use of allogeneic T cells and/or tumours in humanized mouse models. In addition, clinical development presents its own challenges, such as the time, financial and regulatory burdens necessary to test any new CAR-T cell modifications. Another challenge includes the interpretation of clinical data across small clinical trials in which there are often significant differences in other critical factors, such as the manufacturing process and patient populations.\n\nFinally, when considering the effect of a new treatment, it is essential to consider access to this therapy as a potential cause of failure. Indeed, CAR-T cell therapy is a sophisticated therapy that requires significant expertise, infrastructure and cost. Therefore, socioeconomical and geographical factors have a significant role in limiting access to this treatment. Although political reforms and fair distribution of wealth are certainly the key players in reducing inequity in access to CAR-T cells, scientific developments might also play an important part. Point-of-care manufacturing, non-viral transduction strategies, short manufacturing and off-the-shelf products can all potentially reduce costs and ensure larger access to this life-saving therapy.\n\nWe remain optimistic that multiple biologic limitations of the currently approved CAR-T cells can be overcome with creative engineering strategies and combination therapies and that cell-based therapeutics are uniquely poised to enable long-term durable remission in patients with cancer.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965011/)Acknowledgements\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe authors thank the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for their funding support (MVM R01 CA238268, R01 CA252940, R01 CA249062 and P01 CA233412).

The _TRAC_ locus has been extensively studied as an ideal target for both gene knockout and CAR knock-in. In this study, the authors used CRISPR–Cas9 to integrate a CD19-specific CAR coding sequence into the _TRAC_ locus, aiming to eliminate existing TCRs while introducing the CD19-specific CAR in a manner that allows it to be regulated by the natural _TCR_ promoter. This genetic modification unexpectedly led to several advantageous outcomes, including enhanced T cell functionality and improved control of pre-B-ALL.\n*   103.MacLeod DT et al.

This report describes a novel mechanism for antigen-negative escape after CAR-T cell therapy. It provides a characterization of frameshift mutations occurring in exons 2 and 4 of the _CD19_ gene and of alternative spliced _CD19_ mRNA variants. These findings are based on the analysis of the initial four patients with B-ALL who participated in a clinical trial conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Remarkably, the study demonstrates that anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy exerts selective pressure on cells, leading to pre-existing alternatively spliced CD19 isoforms that compromise the efficacy of CAR-T cell treatment.\n*   140.Fischer J. et al.

This study finds extensive interpatient and intrapatient heterogeneity in tumour expression of CAR-T cell target antigens, including CD19. An analysis of the immunological synapse revealed that CD28 H/T domain-expressing CAR-T cells were more efficient at recognizing low-density antigens and forming clusters to induce T cell activation.

This article analyses the role of faecal microbiota composition of patients receiving second-generation anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of B cell malignancies. The exposure of patients to broad-spectrum antibiotics correlated with worse overall survival and progression-free survival and a greater incidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. In addition, the presence of certain microbial taxa, specifically the class Clostridia, was associated with higher rates of complete response following CAR-T cell infusion, whereas _Bacteroides_ was associated with toxicity.

Substantial clinical experience and success has been reported with monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics targeting CD22.21–29 We report the first clinical experience using a CD22-CAR in pre-B ALL19,30. Our data demonstrate that CD22-CAR expressing T cells have a similar safety profile to CD19-CARs and mediate similarly potent anti-leukemic effects, in both immunotherapy-naïve patients and patients with CD19 dim/negative relapse following CD19-directed immunotherapy. These results are the first to establish that CAR expressing T cells targeting antigens other than CD19 can mediate similarly potent antineoplastic effects and the first to demonstrate [...] ### Links to NCBI Databases\n\nOn this page\n\n   Abstract\n   Graphical Abstract\n   INTRODUCTION\n   RESULTS\n   DISCUSSION\n   METHODS\n   Supplementary Material\n   Acknowledgments\n   Footnotes\n   References\n   Associated Data\n\nCite\n\n   Copy\n   Download .nbib.nbib\n   Format:  \n\nAdd to Collections\n\nCreate a new collection \n\nAdd to an existing collection \n\n Name your collection  \n\n Choose a collection  \n\n Unable to load your collection due to an error\n\nPlease try again\n\n Add  Cancel \n\n Follow NCBI \n\nNCBI on X (formerly known as Twitter)NCBI on FacebookNCBI on LinkedInNCBI on GitHubNCBI RSS feed\n\nConnect with NLM\n\nNLM on X (formerly known as Twitter)NLM on FacebookNLM on YouTube\n\nNational Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894 [...] ### A bispecific CAR targeting both CD19 and CD22 can recognize and kill CD19+CD22+, CD19−CD22+ and CD22+CD19− B-ALL",

CD22 is also expressed on most B-ALL and usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase I trial testing a novel CD22-CAR in twenty-one children and adults, including 17 previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose dependent anti-leukemic activity was observed with complete remission in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving ≥ 1 × 10 6 CD22-CART cells/kg, including 5/5 patients with CD19dim/neg B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted escape from killing by CD22-CART cells. These results are the first to eastablish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in pre-B cell ALL, including in leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating comparable potency to CD19-CART at biologically active doses in B-ALL. They also highlight the critical role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function.

Blinatumomab, a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody, mediates impressive effects in patients with overt[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R8),[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R9) and minimal residual disease (MRD) levels of B-ALL[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R10). T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have also demonstrated impressive antileukemic effects in children and adults with relapsed/refractory B-ALL with remission rates ranging from 70–90%.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R11)–[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R13) However, the likelihood of durable remission following CD19 targeted immunotherapy remains unknown. Although CD19 is expressed on essentially all cases of B-ALL at clinical presentation[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R14),[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R15), relapses with loss or diminished surface expression of CD19 are increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure.[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R12),[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R16)–[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R18)\n\nLike CD19, CD22 is expressed on most cases of pre-B cell ALL[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R14),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R19),[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R20), and normal tissue expression is restricted to the B cell lineage. Substantial clinical experience and success has been reported with monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics targeting CD22.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R21)–[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R29) We report the first clinical experience using a CD22-CAR in pre-B ALL[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R19),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R30). Our data demonstrate that CD22-CAR expressing T cells have a similar safety profile to CD19-CARs and mediate similarly potent anti-leukemic effects, in both immunotherapy-naïve patients and patients with CD19 dim/negative relapse following CD19-directed immunotherapy. These results are the first to establish that CAR expressing T cells targeting antigens other than CD19 can mediate similarly potent antineoplastic effects and the first to demonstrate that resistance to immunotherapy via antigen loss can be overcome by treatment with CAR T cells targeting an alternative antigen, opening the way to dual targeted immunotherapeutics.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/)RESULTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Patient Characteristics\n\nThe first twenty-one consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with CD22 CAR T cells are included in this analysis. The median age was 19 years (range 7–30 years), and all patients had undergone at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 2 patients had received 2 prior HSCTs ([Supplementary Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). Seventeen patients had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 15 who received prior CD19-CAR therapy. Lymphoblasts were CD19-negative or dim in 10 patients, including 9 following CD19-CAR therapy and 1 following blinatumomab. Median marrow blast percentage was 70.5% (range 1%-99%) and all were CNS1 (< 5 WBC/mcL and no blasts). Median CD22 site density was 2839 molecules per cell (range 613–13452). Fourteen patients manifested B-cell aplasia at enrollment (B cell counts < 50 cells/mcL), including 7 patients who had received prior therapy with a CD19-CAR suggesting ongoing effects of the previous CAR therapy please clarify why this is important. You need to provide more information for the general reader.Also, please describe in more detail the design of the CAR so that readers know from the outset that it is CD22.BB.z. All treated patients received the intended protocol-specified cell dose of T cells modified to express the anti-CD22 CAR construct which is based on a binding domain previously reported[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R30) and modified to incorporate a 41BB endodomain which has been shown to improve persistence.[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R31) A schematic of the anti-CD22 CAR construct is shown in [Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1). Product characteristics are shown in [Supplemental Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1).\n\n#### Figure 1.

Copies of integrated CD22-CAR transgene per 100 mcg of DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\n### Toxicity\n\nThe primary toxicity was cytokine release syndrome (CRS)[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R11)–[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R13) occurring in 16/21 patients, coinciding with CAR T cell expansion, and with onset after day +5 in all patients. Protocol-defined (supplemental methods) grade 1 CRS occurred in 9 patients and grade 2 CRS occurred in 7 patients. Patient #2 experienced grade 3 self-limited, non-infectious, diarrhea during CRS which resolved with supportive care, but resulted in a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the first dose level requiring a protocol-specified expansion of the first dose level to 6 patients with no further DLTs observed. Three patients received dose level 2 (1×10 6/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg) with no evidence of DLT. Two patients then proceeded to dose level 3 (3 × 10 6/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg), and patient #10 developed dose limiting grade 4 hypoxia associated with rapid disease progression requiring brief intubation with complete resolution of the hypoxia within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. A second patient was safely treated at this dose level without DLT. Based on the single DLT at dose level 3 and clinical activity associated with significant CD22-CAR T cell expansion and persistence at dose level 2, 1×10 6/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg was identified as the recommended phase II dose and the cohort was expanded to ten additional patients (n=13 total at dose level 2). One subject (patient #14) with a pre-enrollment history of multi-organ failure due to sepsis, died from gram negative rod sepsis developing after resolution of CRS and neutrophil count recovery to >1000 cells/mcL. Prospective neurotoxicity evaluations demonstrated no irreversible neurotoxicity or seizure. Amongst the first 16 patients with complete assessments, transient visual hallucinations (n=2), mild unresponsiveness (n=1), mild disorientation (n=1) and mild-moderate pain (n=2) were observed but returned to baseline by day 28 post-infusion. B-cell aplasia (< 50 cells/mcL) was noted in all patients achieving remission, including patients who were not previously B-cell aplastic. Grade 3–4 toxicities possibly, probably or definitely attributed to the CD22-CAR are listed in [Supplemental Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1).\n\n### CD22 CARs Demonstrate Robust Expansion and Anti-leukemic Activity\n\nCAR expansion, persistence and response for individual patients are summarized in [Supplemental Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1). As shown in [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1), CD22-CAR T cells were detected in the peripheral blood of 19/21 treated patients, peaking on Day 14. Median peak expansion was 62% of circulating T cells expressing the CD22-CAR ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1), range 1–91%), median circulating CAR T cell number was 316/mcl ([Figure 1C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1), range 1–3593/mcl), and median peak expansion in the first 16 patients, measured by PCR for CAR DNA sequence was 7007 copies/100ng DNA ([Figure 1D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1), range 15–30,500 copies/100ng DNA). On Day 28, CAR T cells remained detectable in the peripheral blood of 15/21 patients, in the bone marrow in 15/19 patients for whom bone marrow flow was performed (median 25%, range 0–78.2%) and in the cerebrospinal fluid in 12/17 patients for whom CSF analysis was performed (range 21–71.6%). CAR-T cells remained detectable in the blood of 7 of 9 patients evaluated 3 months post-infusion, in 2 of 3 patients evaluated at 6 months post-infusion, and in one patient each evaluated 9 and 18 months post-infusion who were in ongoing remission at these timepoints.\n\nTwelve patients (57%) achieved a complete remission (CR) ([Figure 2A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F2)); 9 were MRD negative ([Supplemental Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). Response varied with administered cell dose. At the first dose level (3×10 5 CD22-CAR/kg) 1 of 6 patients attained a CR compared to 11 of 15 patients (73%) at doses ≥ 1 × 10 6 CD22-CAR/kg (p<0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Among patients receiving ≥ 1 × 10 6 CD22-CAR/kg, complete remissions occurred in 9/10 patients who had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 5/5 who enrolled with CD19dim/neg B-ALL and 1 patient who was refractory to both CD19-CAR and blinatumomab (patient #11). Thus, we saw no evidence that previous CD19-directed immunotherapy or diminished expression of CD19 impacted response to CD22-CAR T cells. [Figure 2B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F2) illustrates response in patient #2 whose leukemia had dim CD19 expression with substantial disease burden and experienced an MRD negative complete remission following infusion of 3×10 5 CAR T cells/kg. Similarly, patient #15 had complete absence of surface CD19 expression and high disease burden, but attained MRD negative remission with grade 1 CRS and considerable lymphocyte expansion ([Figure 2C and D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F2)). Reponses were also seen in patients with extramedullary disease, including patient #13 who attained MRD negative marrow remission at day 28, with steady decrease in FDG-glucose uptake in lymphomatous disease, which fully resolved by 5 months post CAR infusion ([Figure 2E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F2)).\n\n#### Figure 2. CD22 CAR T cells induce remission in patients with relapsed and refractory pre-B ALL including CD19 CAR-resistant ALL.\n\n[![Image 11: Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b64/5774642/9644b1f0b81a/nihms913214f2.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5774642_nihms913214f2.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/figure/F2/)\n\nA.

Magnification 200x. D. Serial PET scans showing pre-treatment disease and evolution to full resolution in post-treatment evaluations in patient #13.\n\nAmong the 4 non-responders at dose levels 2 and 3, two (patients #10 and #18) demonstrated very high disease burden with rapid disease progression, which may have contributed to lack of response. Two additional non-responders (patients #12 and #17) expressed dim or partial CD22 on leukemic blasts at the time of enrollment, which emerged following inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22/calicheamicin conjugate,[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R29) administered immediately prior to enrollment on this study.\n\nSerum cytokines were measured serially during the first month in all patients ([Supplemental Figures 1 and 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1), representative images). Similar to previous reports following CD19-CAR therapy, we saw a general correlation between high leukemia burden and high peak cytokine levels, as illustrated by patient #4 and patient #9.\n\n### Relapse is Associated with Diminished CD22 Site Density Without Detectable CD22 Mutations or Changes in CD22 mRNA Level\n\nAmong the 12 patients who attained complete remission, 3 remain in ongoing complete remission at 21 mos, 9 mos, and 6 mos ([Supplemental Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). Eight patients relapsed 1.5–12 mos (median 6 months) post CD22-CAR infusion and relapse was associated with diminished CD22 expression in 7 patients ([Figure 3A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F3)). Illustrative examples include patient #9, who enrolled with CD19 negative leukemia and experienced relapse 6 months following CD22-CAR therapy with blasts that were negative for both CD19 and CD22 ([Figure 3B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F3)). Two patients who enrolled after receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin experienced early relapse including Patient #11, who relapsed at 1.5 mos following anti-CD22-CAR infusion with low but variable CD22 expression on leukemic blasts ([Figure 3C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F3)) and patient #15 with CD19 negative leukemia following CD19-CAR therapy who relapsed with variable dim to negative CD22 expression 2 months following CD22-CAR infusion ([Figure 3D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F3)), despite high-levels of circulating CD22-CAR cells ([Figure 2C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F2)).\n\n#### Figure 3.

Change in CD22 expression levels in patients achieving remission following CD22 CAR T cell therapy who subsequently developed relapse. Site density measured by flow cytometry as described in methods.. B. Patient #9 who enrolled with CD19 negative B-ALL, experienced an MRD negative remission following CD22-CAR, with subsequent relapse at 6 months demonstrating emergence of 2 leukemic populations with altered CD22 expression compared to pretreatment. C. Relapse with CD22 negative ALL following MRD negative remission in Patient #15 with pretreatment CD19 negative ALL. Last therapy prior to anti-CD22 CAR was with inotuzumab ozogamicin. At the time of relapse, 23% of T-cells in the marrow and 14.4% of T-cells in the peripheral blood were CD22 CAR positive. D. Patient #11 relapsed 1.5 mos following CD22 CAR infusion with CD22lo B-ALL. Therapy administered immediately prior to anti-CD22 CAR was inotuzumab ozogamicin\n\nRather than the persistent and complete absence of target that has been reported following CD19 directed immunotherapy due to preferential expression of CD19 splice variants in resistant leukemia lacking the targeted epitope[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R16), we observed a pattern of acquired resistance to CD22-CAR associated with diminished ([Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F3)) and variable ([Supplemental Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)) CD22 site density assessed by flow cytometry as described in Methods. To determine whether diminished CD22 site density may have had a causal role in relapse in this setting by enabling escape from CD22-CAR T cells, we assessed functionality of the CD22-CAR against NALM6 derived cell lines engineered to express varying CD22 site densities reflecting the range observed in this study ([Figure 4A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F4)). IFN-gamma ([Figure 4B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F4)) and IL-2 ([Figure 4C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F4)) production by CD22-CAR T cells was reduced following exposure to NALM6 expressing low CD22 density corresponding to levels observed at the time of relapse in patients following CD22-CAR therapy. Finally, although CD22 CAR T cells delay _in vivo_ progression of CD22lo ALL, leukemia progression eventually ensues ([Figure 4D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F4)). These results implicate diminished CD22 expression on B-ALL as a mechanism for relapse following CD22-CAR therapy.\n\n#### Figure 4. CD22 site density limits CD22 CAR functionality.\n\n[![Image 13: Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6b64/5774642/2120599153e4/nihms913214f4.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=5774642_nihms913214f4.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/figure/F4/)\n\nA.

Representative of 3 independent experiments.\n\nTo identify possible genetic or transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the observed alteration in CD22 site density, longitudinal assessment of the CD22 genomic locus and corresponding mRNA was evaluated in two patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR with diminished CD22 site density. Genome-wide copy number profiles of the leukemias remained stable despite substantial changes in CD22 site density. Heterozygosity of the CD22 locus was maintained and no focal copy number changes were observed. Mutation analysis comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples demonstrated no aquired mutations within the CD22 locus ([Figure 5A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F5), [Supplemental Figure 4A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). Corresponding analysis of CD22 mRNA levels pre- and post-CD22 CAR treatment demonstrated no qualitative change in the observed CD22 transcripts, and no evidence for diminished transcription of CD22, since in each case, total CD22 mRNA levels were slightly increased at the time that CD22 site density was diminished ([Figure 5B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F5), [Supplemental Figure 4B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). We saw no evidence for alternative CD22 isoforms as a cause of the downmodulation of CD22 expression observed although a novel isoform cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, we studied a patient derived xenograft model in mice subjected to pressure with CD22-CAR T cells which induced complete loss of CD22 surface expression. Remarkably, such leukemias again showed no evidence for genetic mutation, changes in gene copy number or isoform expression and no evidence for diminished mRNA expression ([Figure 5D and E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F5)). Together, the data implicate post-transcriptional effects in modulating CD22 protein levels rather genomic mutation, modulation of gene expression or altered isoform expression.\n\n#### Figure 5.

(C) A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) developed from patient #5 was treated _in vivo_ with CD22 CAR which showed tumor response followed by CD22 flow cytometry-negative relapse. (D) Genome-wide copy number and CD22 exon analysis demonstrated genomic stability from the primary tumor with no gains, losses and maintenance of the ploidy status before and after therapy. (E) CD22 transcript levels in the pre and post treatment sample again showed maintenance of consistent mRNA expression.\n\n### A bispecific CAR targeting both CD19 and CD22 can recognize and kill CD19+CD22+, CD19−CD22+ and CD22+CD19− B-ALL\n\nMulti-agent combination chemotherapy is a central tenet of ALL therapy. The results presented here credential a novel CAR-based therapeutic for the treatment of B-ALL, but also illustrate the challenges associated with sequential administration of CD19 CAR followed by CD22 CAR therapy. We therefore sought to develop a multi-specific CAR T cell which could simultaneously recognize CD19 or CD22 expressing targets. Using a single CAR construct that incorporates both CD19 and CD22 scFv sequences into one bivalent receptor ([Figure 6A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F6)), we demonstrate _in vitro_ cytokine production against and killing of CD19+/CD22+, CD19+/CD22−, and CD22−CD19+ cell B-ALL cell lines ([Figures 6B and C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F6), [Supplemental Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1)). T cells transduced with this mutispecific construct administered intravenously at a dose 3 × 10 6 into NSG mice 3 days after injection of luciferase-expressing B-ALL demonstrate the ability to clear B-ALL ([Figure 6D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F6)). Thus, the binding domain in the CD22 CAR validated in the clinical trial reported here can be combined with a CD19 binding domain validated as a CAR construct in multiple clinical trials to generate a single multitarget CAR with the potential to overcome leukemic resitance to either CAR administered alone.\n\n#### Figure 6.

Epratuzumab, an unconjugated anti-CD22 mAb, mediated modest clinical activity in adult and pediatric ALL.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R21),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R26),[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R27) CD22-immunotoxins mediated clinical activity in hairy cell leukemia[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R23) and B-ALL[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R22), but benefits were transient due to the agent’s short half-life, and substantial immunogenicity. A recent phase 3 trial of inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 mAb conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin, demonstrated complete responses in 80.7% of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R29) However, liver toxicity limited the dose intensity that could be safely delivered and the agent is associated with higher rates of veno-occlusive disease following subsequent HSCT.[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R24),[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R34)\n\nWe generated a novel CAR targeting CD22, which we optimized by comparing potency across multiple scFvs and multiple costimulatory domains.[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R19),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R30),[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R35) Therapeutics incorporating the m971 binding domain[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R30) have not been tested previously in clinical trials. The data presented here demonstrate no evidence for off-target toxicity, modest cytokine release syndrome and potent anti-leukemic activity following CD22-CAR therapy. Doses ≥ 1 × 10 6 CD22-CAR cells/kg mediated substantial anti-leukemic activity, comparable to results with CD19-CAR, with 11/15 patients rendered into complete remission, including 8/10 patients previously treated with CD19 based immunotherapies, and 5/5 patients who enrolled with CD19 neg/dim relapse. Notably, all patients enrolled had undergone previous HSCT and patient #7 who had undergone two previous HSCTs prior to receiving CD22 CAR T-cells, remains in remission 21 months following CD22-CAR therapy with persistent CAR T cells and has received no additional anti-leukemic therapy since treatment with CD22-CAR T cells. Together, the data provides no evidence to suggest that previous chemotherapy or CD19-based immunotherapy diminishes the likelihood of remission induction following bioactive doses of CD22-CAR T cells. The CD22-CAR studied here incorporates a 4-1BB costimulatory endodomain, and the cells demonstrate a pattern of expansion and persistence that is similar to that observed following CD19-CAR T cells incorporating a 4-1BB endodomain, consistent with previous evidence that CAR costimulatory domains play a dominant role in modulating the rate of expansion and the likelihood of persistence following CAR therapy.[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R35) CD22-CAR cells also migrated efficiently to the CSF, but we observed no evidence for severe neurologic toxicity or seizures, which have been observed in studies of CD19-CAR therapy.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R11)–[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R13)\n\nCARs targeting CD19 have demonstrated remarkable activity in B-ALL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and we demonstrate similar complete response rates in B-ALL with the CD22-CAR tested here. This is notable since numerous non-CD19 targeted CARs have entered clinical trials for B cell malignancies, (CD20-CAR[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R36), κ-CAR[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R37), CD138-CAR[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R38), BCMA-CAR[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R39)), AML[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R40) and solid tumors, yet none of these have demonstrated complete responses rates of >50%. This work therefore provides the first evidence that CD19 is not a uniquely effective CAR T cell target and raise the prospect that similarly effective CARs could ultimately be developed for an array of antigenic targets. Future studies are needed to determine whether the high rates observed with CD22-CARs in B-ALL will translate into similarly significant response rates in DLBCL, where CD22 expression is common.\n\nCD19 is universally expressed at high levels on B-ALL at the time of diagnosis and is retained following cytotoxic therapy.[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R41)–[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R43) However, since the introduction of CD19-based immunotherapies, relapse with diminished or absent surface CD19 has been increasingly observed and has emerged as the dominant mechanism of resistance to this class of therapeutics. CD19 immune escape was first reported following blinatumumab therapy[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R10), but has now been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy.[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R12),[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R44) In a recent report of 50 patients rendered into remission with CD19-CAR therapy, with a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 40% of patients had relapsed, and loss of the CD19 target accounted for 65% of the total relapses.[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R17) Thus, while the true incidence is unknown, CD19 immune escape is emerging as the most common cause of relapse following CD19-CAR therapy for B-ALL. Recent investigation into the biology of “CD19 negative B-ALL” has revealed that the majority of cases retain mRNA specific for CD19, but are enriched for CD19 isoforms that preferentially remain intracellular and/or lack the epitopes targeted by all CD19-CARs currently under study as well as blinatumumab.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R16) An alternative pathway for loss or diminished CD19 expression involves lineage switch of blasts with acquisition of myeloid markers and characteristics.[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R45) None of the patients enrolled on this study appeared to manifest CD19 loss associated with lineage switch.\n\nThe data presented here demonstrate that diminished CD22 site density, rather than total loss of expression, is sufficient to permit escape of leukemia from CD22-directed CAR therapy. This is not unique to the CD22-CAR, but rather reflects a pattern observed across chimeric antigen receptors, which demonstrate a higher requirement for antigen induced activation than is seen for native T cell receptors[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R46)–[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R49). Decrease in CD22 site density or complete CD22 loss were observed in 7/8 patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR induced remission. Given that CD22 expression is often variable at presentation, it appears likely that this phenomena represents selection of pre-existing CD22lo cells within the heterogeneous leukemia population. Notably, we identified no genetic basis for the change in expression level and no evidence for diminished mRNA levels in leukemic cells demonstrating low CD22 site density, thus implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms in this biology. Regardless of the mechanism, decades of experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy for B-ALL have convincingly established that multimodal chemotherapy is required to achieve long-term remission. Based on clear evidence for CD19 antigen loss or downregulation following CD19-directed immunotherapy, and evidence for diminished CD22 expression contributing to relapse following sequential CAR therapy, we propose that simultaneous immunotherapeutic targeting of multiple antigens may diminish the likelihood of antigen loss escape. Proof-of-principle for bioactivity of a multispecific CD19/CD22-CAR in mice is demonstrated here.\n\nThe majority of patients who develop CD19 immune escape following CD19 directed immunotherapy retain CD22 expression and this report demonstrates that such leukemias retain susceptible to immune-based targeting. Furthermore, while we demonstrate proof-of principle that sequential immunotherapeutic targeting of a second antigen can mediate clinical benefit, we also observe a high rate of relapse associated with diminution in CD22 expression using this approach, raising the prospect that simultaneous multispecific targeting may be a more effective approach to enhance the durability of immunotherapy-induced remissions in B-ALL. Toward this end, we have developed a chimeric antigen receptor that simultaneously targets both CD19 and CD22, which could prove more effective at inducing remissions and be less susceptible to relapse associated with antigen escape[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R50). Clinical trials testing this CD19/CD22 mutispecific target CAR are underway.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/)METHODS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Trial Design and Toxicity Monitoring\n\nThis Phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation trial conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute was designed to test the safety and feasibility of CD22-CAR T cell therapy in children and young adults, aged 1–30 years, with relapsed or refractory CD22 expressing hematopoietic malignancies which had not responded to or had recurred following standard regimens. The protocol was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board and the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ([NCT02315612](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02315612)). All authors reviewed, discussed and interpreted the study results and vouch for the data and analyses. Written informed consent for participation was obtained from patients or the parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.. This report represents an interim analysis from the first, consecutively treated 21 patients with pre-B ALL who received CD22-CAR T cell infusions between December 2014 and August 2016 with a data cut-off of June 1, 2017. A total of 23 subjects were enrolled, but in one case T lymphocyte numbers were inadequate for CAR cell production and thus this patient was not treated on study; in a second case the diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which is not included in this analysis of efficacy in B-ALL.\n\nA standard 3 + 3 Phase I dose escalation design was used. If 2/6 patients experienced a DLT at dose level 1, safety would have been evaluated in a de-escalated dose of 1 × 10 5 transduced T cells/kg. Once the maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) was reached, enrollment into an expansion cohort of a total of 12 patients in two strata proceeded to provide additional information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment. In the expansion cohort, patients who have previously received CD19-CAR T cells will be evaluated as a separate stratum from CAR-naïve patients. All doses allowed a range of ± 20% of the prescribed dose to allow for potential variations in the cell products.\n\nDose limiting toxicity was defined as any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity attributed as possibly, probably, or likely related to either the lymphodepletion regimen or the CD22-CAR T cells with exception of low electrolyte levels responding to supplementation, tumor lysis syndrome, hypoalbuminemia, liver dysfunction resolved to < grade 2 within 14 days, transient (< 72 hours) grade 4 hepatic enzyme abnormality, pre-existing coagulopathy, grade 3 or 4 fever lasting 7 days or less, grade 3 diarrhea that resolves to grade 2 within 4 days, grade 3 nausea and/or anorexia and any infusion related toxicity occurring within 24 hours that would resolve with minimal intervention. and grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Cytokine release syndrome was graded and managed based on Lee et al.[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R51) Additionally, subjects with abnormal blood counts at baseline due to marrow involvement were not evaluable for hematologic toxicity.\n\nTo evaluate possible neurotoxic effects, psychologists administered a brief (<1 hour) neurocognitive battery to patients prior to (baseline) and 1-month after (day 21–28) CD22 CAR T cell infusion. The test battery consisted of the NIH Toolbox computerized test[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R1) evaluating attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and a paper/pencil test assessing processing speed[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R2). At baseline and then at approximately 14 and 21 days post-infusion, the caregiver of the patient or the adult patient completed a neuro-symptom checklist that assessed fever, auditory or visual hallucinations, responsiveness to commands, disorientation, depressed mood, and pain.[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R52)\n\n### Eligibility\n\nPatients were eligible if their disease had recurred after standard upfront therapy and at least one salvage therapy. There was no limit on the number of previous salvage therapies the patient may have received. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant was allowed if at least 100 days had elapsed since transplant, there was no evidence of GVHD and the patient was off systemic immunosuppression for at least 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients who had received prior CD19-CAR therapy were eligible if at least 30 days had elapsed since CD19-CAR infusion and circulating levels of genetically modified cells were <5% by flow cytometry.\n\nEligibility required a performance status of ≥ 50% by Karnofksy for patients > 16 years of age, or ≥ 50% using the Lansky scale for patients < 16 years of age. Minimal weight for eligibility was 15 kg. Patients with asymptomatic CNS1 or CNS2 leukemia were eligible, whereas patients with symptomatic or CNS3 leukemia were ineligible, as previously described.[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R12) Patients with isolated CNS or testicular leukemia were not eligible.\n\nPatients with uncontrolled intercurrent infection, other malignancies, illnesses or conditions that would limit their ability to tolerate or comply with the study requirements were ineligible. Patients were also ineligible if they demonstrated seropositivity for HIV or HCV or positive testing for HBV surface antigen or if they had a history of hypersensitivity to agents required for the treatment regimen. Other exclusion criteria included inadequate liver function defined as total bilirubin > 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with documented Gilbert’s) or transaminase levels > 3× ULN; renal function < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or hyperleukocytosis (≥50,000 circulating blasts/uL).\n\nSystemic chemotherapy must have been completed > 2 weeks prior to enrollment (> 6 weeks for clofarabine or nitrosureas), radiation therapy must have been completed > 3 weeks prior to enrollment, monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy must have been completed at least 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to enrollment and investigational anti-neoplastic therapy must have been completed at least 30 days prior to enrollment. No washout period was required for intrathecal chemotherapy, hydroxyurea (provided no increase in dose within 2 weeks prior to enrollment), standard maintenance ALL therapy or physiologic steroid replacement.\n\n### CD22 CAR Construct and Manufacturing of CD22-CAR T cells\n\nThe CD22-CAR contains a fully human single chain fragment variable region generated from a human B cell phage library[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R30), a CD8 transmembrane domain and CD3 zeta plus 4-1BB signaling chains (CD22.BB.z) as previously described and as illustrated in [Figure 1A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F1).[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R19),[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R35) All patients received the identical preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine 25 mg/m 2/d on Days −4, −3, −2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m 2 on day −2, with CD22-CAR T cell infusion on Day 0. Additional details can be found in the [Supplementary Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1).\n\nCD22-CAR T cells were produced in the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH Clinical Center. This laboratory operates under principles of Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice with established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or protocols for sample receipt, processing, freezing, and analysis. All patients underwent leukapheresis within 5 days following enrollment. Leukapheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cells were either placed directly into culture or cryopreserved prior to culture initiation on a subsequent day. In cases where substantial numbers of myeloid cells were present in the apheresis products, elutriation and/or plastic adherence[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R53) was performed based on evidence that such cells inhibited expansion[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R54). The lentiviral vector containing CD22.BB.Z-CAR, was produced by Lentigen Inc. Cells were expanded in sterile bags in a 37 o C incubator for 9 days, with an additional 3 days of culture permitted to allow resolution of intercurrent clinical events. If > 3 days was required, cells were cryopreserved then thawed immediately prior to infusion. Final product release criteria required the following: cell viability ≥ 70%, cell number within 20% of planned dose, % CAR T cells ≥ 15% as measured using CD22-Fc fusion protein, endotoxin ≤ 5 EU/mL, Mycoplasma negative, gram stain and culture negative, VSV-G DNA (as a surrogate marker for replication competent lentivirus (RCL)) negative by qPCR. In process culture-based testing was also performed on an aliquot of the product at the National Gene Vector Laboratory (Indiana University) using assays for p24 antigen and product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay (PERT) to complete testing for RCL.\n\n### Response Monitoring\n\nBaseline bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed within 14 days prior to beginning the lymphodepletion preparative regimen, and then response was monitored via bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture performed on Day 28 ± 4 days from cell infusion, and at months 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Complete remission (CR) was defined by morphologic assessment of the bone marrow as M1 (<5% leukemic blasts) with no evidence of extramedullary disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry conducted at the NCI Laboratory of Pathology using standard techniques.\n\n### Cytokine Assays, PCR and Flow cytometry\n\nPlasma was cryopreserved before measurement of cytokines in a multiplex format according to manufacturer's instructions (MesoScaleDiscovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). CD22-CAR T cell expansion was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and adapted from published methods[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R55). Briefly, measured CAR copies per 100 ng DNA were normalised to the input quantity of amplifiable DNA by measurement of the single-copy gene, _CDKN1a_.\n\nSpecimens for flow cytometry were processed within 12 h of collection and stained with a panel of antibodies to quantitate leukemic burden and measure CAR T cells numbers. Briefly whole blood lysis was performed using ammonium chloride prior to staining for 30 minutes at room temperature with the following two cocktails (antibody concentration according to manufacturer’s recommendations): Cocktail A- CD16FITC (clone DJ130c, Dako), CD19PE (clone SJ25C1), CD3PerCP (clone SK7, BD), CD13PECy7 (L138, BD), CD34APC (clone 8G12, BD), CD14 APC H7 (MP9, BD), CD56v450 (clone B159, BD), CD45 v500 (clone HI30, BD); and Cocktail B-CD66bFITC (clone G10F5, BD), CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 (clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), CD24APC (clone SN3 A5-2H10, eBioscience), CD45 APC H7 (clone 2D1, BD), CD10BV421 (cloneHI10a, BD) and CD38BV510 (clone HB-7, Biolegend). At least 1 million cells were acquired per tube using an 8-color multiparametric approach on a 3-laser FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with DiVa 6.1.1 software and analyzed by FCS Express 4 software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA). The validated limit of detection of leukemic blasts with this assay is 0.002% of cells.\n\nCD22-CAR T cells were measured using a CD22-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis of estimated blood volume and measured absolute lymphocyte counts. CAR T-cells were detected using the following cocktail: CD20FITC (B-Ly1, Dako), CD10PE (cloneHI10a, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 (clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), CD22-Fc-APC (R&D Systems), CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), CD14 v450 (Mtems), CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), , CD10PE s instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).E content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis of estimated blood volume and measured absolute lymphocyte counts.\n\n### CD19 and CD22 Flow Cytometric Site Density Determination\n\nCD22 and CD19 site density on blasts was enumerated by flow cytometry according to manufacturer's instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The antibody bound per cell (ABC) was determined as previously described[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R56),[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R57) for anti-CD19PE (clone SJ25C1) and anti-CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on leukemic blasts using saturating concentrations of antibody and the BD Biosciences QuantiBRITE system (QuantiBRITE standard beads and QuantiCALC software) for fluorescence quantitation. The ABC value represents the mean value of the maximum capacity of each cell to bind the antibody. QuantiBRITE PE beads are pre-calibrated standard beads containing known numbers of PE molecules bound per bead. QuantiBRITE beads were acquired on a FACSCanto™II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on the same day at the same instrument settings as the individual patient specimens. A standard curve comparing the geometric mean of fluorescence to known PE content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. The regression analysis, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were determined. By gating based upon immunophenotype, blasts were distinguished from normal cells and the geometric mean fluorescence of CD19 and CD22 staining was reported for each population. The ABC values were generated from the measured geometric mean fluorescence of the gated cells using the QuantiBRITE standard curve. ABC values were only determined for populations containing 100 or greater events to achieve adequate precision. The geometric mean fluorescence of T- and NK-cells stained with the B-cell antibodies (negative control) has been previously determined and the negative ABC range is used to confirm positivity versus negativity. In addition, blasts with anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 staining less than or equal to T-cells (internal negative control) are considered negative.\n\n### CRISPR/Cas9 Editing of cell lines\n\nGuide-RNAs were designed from the GeCKO human sgRNAs library, cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene Plasmid 52961), and transformed into Stbl3 bacteria as previously published (hCD19F: 5’ CACCGTGGAATGTTTCGGACCTAGG 3’, hCD19R: 5’ AAACCCTAGGTCCGAAACATTCCAC 3’, hCD22F: 5’ CACCGTCTCCTTCTCGAATCGGCAT 3’, and hCD22R: 5’ AAACATGCCGATTCGAGAAGGAGAC 3’). Plasmids were co-transfected with packaging plasmids RRE, pMD-G, and REV into LentiX HEK293T cells (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). After two days, CRISPR supernatants were harvested and filtered through a 0.45µm low protein binding membrane (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), resuspended in PBS, and used immediately or stored at −80°C. For viral transduction, 1×10 5 leukemia cells were incubated with 10µl of concentrated viral supernatant for 2 days, followed by expansion in RPMI with 10%FBS, Pen/Strep, and Glutamax. Cell phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry, followed by sorting of cells with phenotypic alterations and single cell cloning. Sequencing was performed on single cell clones to confirm genotypic alterations by Plantinum PCR Supermix High Fidelity Kit (Invitrogen) (hCD19F Seq: 5’ TCTCCCTCTCCTGGGTG 3’, hCD19R Seq: 5’ CTCTCCCTCCCAGATCTCAG 3’, hCD22F Seq: 5’ AGGAGGGAAGGGGTACTG 3’, and hCD22R Seq: 5’ AGCCAACGTTTTGGATCTTCAG 3’). To obtain cell lines with various CD22 site densities, a complete sequence of cDNA human CD22 plasmid (Origene) was re-transduced into the CD22-negative cell line at different concentrations. Cell lines were single-cell cloned with resultant cell lines including CD22-negative (CD22 neg), CD19-negative (CD19 neg), CD2-low site density (CD22 lo), and CD22-high site density (CD22 hi) cell lines. QuantiBRITE Beads (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used, as per above description to identify site density of CRISPR/Cas9-modified cell lines.\n\n### CD19xCD22 Bispecific CAR\n\nA Bispecific CAR construct was developed using a CD19 binding domain derived from a clinically active CD19 CAR[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R12) and a CD22 binding domain used for the CD22 CAR reported herein. A schematic of the CD19xCD22 bispecific CAR is shown in [Figure 4A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#F4) and the full sequence is provided [Supplemental Figure 6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#SD1).\n\nThe bispecific CAR was transduced onto human T cells using lentiviral vectors. The potency of the bispecific CAR was tested against the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out cell lines as well as parental Nalm6 ALL cell line. Cytokine production was analyzed in cell co-culture supernatants using R&D ELISA Kit for Interferon-gamma and IL-2, following the product protocol (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). In brief, CD22 CAR T cells were washed three times and co-incubated with varying tumor target cells at 1:1 effector-to-target ratio for 16–20 hours. Supernatant was collected from co-incubation and used for evaluation of cytokine production. Of note, supernatant was diluted 1:10 in media for Interferon-gamma analysis. Supernatant was not diluted for IL-2 evaluation. Optical density was determined within 30 minutes, using a microplate reader set to 450nm with wavelength correction of 540nm. _In vitro_ killing was analyzed using an Incucyte assay (Essen bioscience). CAR cells were co-incubated with GFP-positive tumor target cells at a range of effector-to-target ratio. At the 24-hour time-point, Green Fluorescent Units per well (GFU/well) was calculated using Incucyte software, standardized to baseline GFU/well and normalized to tumor only wells. Assays were performed in triplicate and data is representative of multiple repeat experiments.\n\n### Xenograft Models\n\n_In vivo_ analysis of CAR activity was conducted using a xenograft model with NOD.Cg-_Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl_/SzJ (NSG, Jackson Laboratories) mice. Mice were injected intravenously with 1×10 6 GFP-positive Nalm6 tumor cells on Day 0. On Day CAR-transduced T cells or Mock-transduced T cells were injected as indicated. Mice were imaged using IVIS technology and luciferin-D IP injections. All animal studies were approved by National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n### Genomic Profiling\n\nAll primary patient samples were collected on IRB approved protocols for biological specimen research. Leukemia samples from bone marrow specimens containing greater than 90% leukemia were isolated by density gradient separation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Lonzo). The cells were lysed and nucleic acid extraction was performed using Qiagen Allprep Kits (Qiagen) per the manufactures protocol. DNA and RNA were quantified and assessed for quality using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Poly-adenylated RNA libraries were generated and sequenced using TruSeq 4.0 chemistry on a Hiseq2500 (Illumina). Whole exome data was generated using Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5 and TruSeq V4 chemistry and sequenced to a median of 300× coverage using on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina).\n\nWhole exome and RNA-sequencing data was analyzed and mapped using the CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR) pipeline ([https://bioinformatics.cancer.gov/](https://bioinformatics.cancer.gov/)). Reads were aligned to reference genome Hg19. Somatic variant calling was performed using MuTect[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774642/#R58) and copy number alterations were analyzed using Nexus Copy Number Discovery Edition #9. (BioDiscovery). The integrity of the CD22 gene was interrogated by manual inspection using Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV). RNAsequencing reads for each sample were trimmed of their adapters and low quality bases using Trimmomatic software and aligned with reference human Hg38 and Gencode V24 transcripts using STAR software. Expression of CD22 transcript was evaluated using a log2 of the RPKM of RNAseq data.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nDoses of anti-CD22-CAR transduced T-cells were administered in a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design until MTD was determined. After treatment of the first patient in the first cohort there was a four-week (28 day) safety assessment prior to treatment of the second patient. Subsequent patients in a cohort were treated after a one-week safety assessment period following cell infusion. Patients were enrolled sequentially; therefore, enrollment did not proceed to a higher dose level until all patients had been treated in the prior cohort and the last patient treated on the completed cohort had been observed for at least 4 weeks. If a minimum of 1 ×10 5 anti-CD22-CAR-transduced T cells per kg cannot be obtained for infusion, the patient may be treated but would not be evaluable for toxicity or response, but would be considered a feasibility failure. Up to 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in cohorts 1 to 4 (24 total in order to determine MTD. In addition, the study will allow for up to 3 patients to be replaced in each of the dose cohorts 1 through 3 (9 additional patients) due to inability to achieve target doses. In addition, the study will allow for 6 total in-evaluable patients (patients enrolled but who cannot receive cells, either due to physical deterioration or withdrawn consent during cell growth).\n\n### Data Availability\n\nPatient-related data not included in the manuscript may be restricted as it was generated in the context of an ongoing clinical trial and may be subject to patient confidentiality.

However, more than half of patients relapse after CAR-T or TCE therapy, with antigen escape or lineage switching accounting for one-third of disease recurrences. To minimize tumor escape, dual-targeting CAR-T cell therapies simultaneously targeting CD19 and CD22 have been developed and validated both preclinically and clinically.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe have generated the first dual-targeting strategy for B-cell malignancies based on CD22 CAR-T cells secreting an anti-CD19 TCE antibody (CAR-STAb-T) and conducted a comprehensive preclinical characterization comparing its therapeutic potential in B-ALL with that of previously validated dual-targeting CD19/CD22 tandem CAR cells (TanCAR-T cells) and co-administration of two single-targeting CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells (pooled CAR-T cells).\n\nResults:\n\nWe demonstrate that CAR-STAb-T cells efficiently redirect bystander T cells, resulting in higher cytotoxicity of B-ALL cells than dual-targeting CAR-T cells at limiting effector:target ratios. Furthermore, when antigen loss was replicated in a heterogeneous B-ALL cell model, CAR-STAb T cells induced more potent and effective cytotoxic responses than dual-targeting CAR-T cells in both short- and long-term co-culture assays, reducing the risk of CD19-positive leukemia escape. In vivo, CAR-STAb-T cells also controlled leukemia progression more efficiently than dual-targeting CAR-T cells in patient-derived xenograft mouse models under T cell-limiting conditions.\n\nConclusions:\n\nCD22 CAR-T cells secreting CD19 T-cell engagers show an enhanced control of B-ALL progression compared with CD19/CD22 dual CAR-based therapies, supporting their potential for clinical testing.\n\nFrontiers in immunology\n\nCase Report: Unedited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell bridging to conditioning-free hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a child with refractory Burkitt lymphoma\n\nAuthor: Qian, Juan  ; Wang, Jianmin  ; Luo, Changying  ; Yang, Xiaomin  ; Li, Benshang  ; Luo, Chengjuan  ; Qin, Xia  ; Zhang, Jian  ; Huang, Xiaohang  ; Chen, Jing\n\nPurpose:\n\nBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common tumor of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in children, accounting for about 40% of cases. Although different combined short-course chemotherapies have achieved a good effect, refractory/relapsed BL has a poor prognosis with cure rates less than 30%. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has developed rapidly in recent years and achieved excellent results in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, in some cases, there is a failure to produce autologous CAR-T cells because of T-cell dysfunction. In such cases, allogeneic CAR-T therapy has to be considered.\n\nMethods:\n\nA 17-year-old boy with stage II BL did not respond to extensive chemotherapy and sequential autologous CAR-T therapy. Lentiviral vectors containing anti-CD20-BB-ζ (20CAR) and anti-CD22-BB-ζ (22CAR) transgenes were used to modify the T cells from an HLA-identical matched unrelated donor. Flow cytometry was used to assess the cytokine analyses and CAR-T cell persistence in peripheral blood, enumerated by qPCR as copies per ug DNA. Informed consent for autologous/allogeneic CAR-T therapy was obtained from the patient and his legal guardian.\n\nResults:\n\nUnedited HLA-matched allogeneic CD20 and CD22 CAR-T cells were infused after lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The patient experienced Grade IV cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and went into complete remission (CR) after anti-inflammatory treatment including tocilizumab. Because of persistent pancytopenia and full donor chimerism, the same donor’s conditioning-free peripheral blood stem cells were successfully transplanted 55 days post CAR-T. Neutrophils were engrafted at day +11 and platelets were rebuilt at day +47 without obvious acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but there was mild chronic GVHD in the skin and eyes. Currently, active anti-rejection therapy is still underway.\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnedited HLA-matched allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy could be an innovative, effective, and safe treatment for children with refractory/relapse BL without obvious acute GVHD. Conditioning-free allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the same donor is feasible for a patient with full donor T-cell chimerism after allogeneic CAR-T. It cannot be ignored that close GVHD monitoring is needed post HSCT.\n\n100 Deals associated with Anti CD22 CAR-T cell therapy (Hebei Senlang Biotechnology)\n\nLogin to view more data\n\n## R&D Status\n\n10  top R&D records.\n\nLogin\n\nto view more data\n\n| Indication | Highest Phase | Country/Location | Organization | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | Phase 2 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 26 Mar 2020 |\n| B-Cell Malignant Neoplasm | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 08 Apr 2022 |\n| Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma refractory | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| refractory acute lymphoid leukemia in relapse | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| Refractory Indolent Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 01 Apr 2020 |\n| Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma | Phase 1 | China | [Hebei Senlangbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd.](/organization/dab8ea4d57a17ffc0b8c1ec42261ce8f) | 11 Mar 2020 |\n\nLogin to view more data\n\n## Clinical Result\n\nIndication\n\nPhase\n\nEvaluation\n\nView All Results\n\n| Study | Phase | Population | Analyzed Enrollment | Group | Results | Evaluation | Publication Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| No Data |\n\nLogin to view more data\n\n## Translational Medicine\n\nBoost your research with our translational medicine data.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n## Deal\n\nBoost your decision using our deal data.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n## Core Patent\n\nBoost your research with our Core Patent data.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n## Clinical Trial\n\nIdentify the latest clinical trials across global registries.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n## Approval\n\nAccelerate your research with the latest regulatory approval information.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n## Regulation\n\nUnderstand key drug designations in just a few clicks with Synapse.\n\nlogin\n\nor\n\n[view full example data](/example-data/drug)\n\n[AI Agents Built for Biopharma Breakthroughs\n\nAccelerate discovery.

It regulates the activity and maturation of B cells mainly by interacting with sugar molecules on the cell surface. CD22 is a supramembrane glycoprotein with a full length of approximately 1350 amino acid residues. CD22 contains a short tail located on the cytoplasmic side and a large N-terminus located extracellularly. The N-terminus of CD22 is rich in Ig structural domains that can be used to bind to other proteins, including the Igα/Igβ subunit within the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex and CD22L, another Siglec family member on the natural killer (NK) cell receptor. These binding interactions can be mediated by regulating multiple key molecules in the B-cell signal transduction pathway. The intracellular tail of CD22 also contains several distinct structural domains, including a titin chain reaction sequence, a CTYC/CXXC-like zinc finger domain, and a Hormone Binding Domain (HBD). Among them, the titin chain reaction sequence and the CTYC/CXXC-like zinc finger domain function mainly to connect CD22 to the B-cell membrane and regulate its signaling pathways. Moreover, CD22 is associated with a variety of B-cell-related diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple sclerosis in adults and children. Based on these findings, CD22 has emerged as a widely studied target for immunotherapy.\n\nFig.1 Structure of CD22\n\n## CD22 Signaling Pathways\n\nCD22 is a negative regulator that binds to Igα/Igβ subunits, thereby inhibiting BCR signaling. In the inactivated state, CD22 inhibits BCR signaling by binding directly to Igα/Igβ subunits, thereby preventing the onset of autoimmune responses. In addition, CD22 can be dissociated by phosphorylation of key enzymes in the presence of activated BCR, thereby releasing the BCR signaling pathway.\n\nThe role of CD22 played in regulating the BCR signaling pathway is an important factor affecting B cell function. Several studies have shown that CD22 is associated with autoimmune diseases and malignant lymphomas. Also, phosphorylation modifications of key CD22 enzymes are abnormal. The expression of CD22 is significantly downregulated in some autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. All these abnormalities may lead to the loss of the original negative regulatory role of CD22, thereby compromising the regulatory BCR signaling pathway and leading to the development of autoimmune diseases.\n\nThe mechanism of action and expression of CD22 in B-cell lymphomas are complex. Some studies have found that the expression of CD22 is different in different types of B-cell lymphomas. CD22 also influences the development and prognosis of lymphoma by regulating the interaction of cell signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment. The role of BCR signaling pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia indicates that BCR signaling pathway plays an important role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, participating in the biological processes of leukemia cell proliferation, survival, invasion and so on. Therefore, inhibition of BCR signaling pathway is expected to be a new target for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, studies have suggested the synergistic effect of CD22 and BCR signaling pathways in Hodgkin's lymphoma. CD22 and BCR signaling pathways have a synergistic effect in Hodgkin's lymphoma, influencing each other to affect the proliferation, survival and metastasis of tumor cells. Therefore, simultaneous targeting of CD22 and BCR signaling pathways may be one of the effective strategies for treating Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n## Clinic Status of CD22-Targeted CAR Cell Therapies\n\nCD22 is widely used in [CAR-T cell therapy](one-stop-car-t-therapy-development-services.htm) as a target for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The therapy uses modified T cells engineered to bind to specific antigen receptors to form CAR-T cells that enable them to recognize and attack excess B cells in the body. CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD22 has shown extremely high cure rates in clinical trials. CD22 There are currently a number of ongoing clinical trials in CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD22. Most of the CD22 CAR-T clinical trials are still in the early stages, including Phase I/II. [CD22 CAR-T](target-cd22-14.htm) cell therapy is mainly used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-cell lymphoma. Most trials use autologous T cells or peripheral blood stem cells as the cell source. CD22 CAR-T cells can be used in combination with other target CAR-T cells to enhance the therapeutic effect. For example, in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, CD22 and CD19 are often expressed together, so the combination of CD22 and [CD19 CAR-T](target-cd19-12.htm) cells can be used to improve the therapeutic effect.\n\nTable 1.

The goal is to see if a new drug, therapy, or approach works better or has fewer side effects than existing options.\n\nHow participants are assigned to different groups/arms  \nIn this clinical study, all participants receive the same treatment. Since there is only one group, there is no need for randomization or assignment to different arms. This type of study is often used to test a new treatment without comparing it to another.  \n  \nOther Ways to Assign Participants **Randomized allocation**: Participants are assigned randomly, like flipping a coin, to ensure fairness and reduce bias. **Non-randomized allocation**: Participants are assigned based on specific factors, such as their medical condition or a doctor's decision.\n\n---\n\nHow treatments are given to participants  \nIn this study, all participants receive the same treatment. This approach is often used to evaluate the effects of a single intervention without comparing it to another.  \n  \nOther Ways to Assign Treatments **Parallel assignment**: Participants are split into separate groups, each receiving a different treatment. **Cross-over assignment**: Participants switch between treatments during the study. **Factorial assignment**: Participants receive different combinations of treatments. **Sequential assignment**: Participants receive treatments one after another in a specific order, possibly based on individual responses. **Other assignment**: Treatment assignment does not follow a standard or predefined design.\n\n---\n\nHow the effectiveness of the treatment is controlled  \nIn a non placebo-controlled study, no participants receive an inert substance (placebo) to compare outcomes. Instead, all participants receive either the experimental treatment or an alternative treatment (often the Standard of Care). This method allows researchers to compare the effects of the experimental treatment with those of a different active intervention, rather than a placebo.  \n  \nOther Options **Placebo-Controlled**: A placebo is used to compare the effects of the experimental treatment with those of an inert substance, isolating the true treatment effect.\n\n---\n\nHow the interventions assigned to participants is kept confidential  \nEveryone involved in the study knows which treatment is being given. This is typically used when it's not possible or necessary to hide the treatment details from participants or researchers.  \n  \nOther Ways to Mask Information **Single-blind**: Participants do not know which treatment they are receiving, but researchers do. **Double-blind**: Neither participants nor researchers know which treatment is given. **Triple-blind**: Participants, researchers, and outcome assessors do not know which treatment is given. **Quadruple-blind**: Participants, researchers, outcome assessors, and care providers all do not know which treatment is given.\n\n---\n\n### Eligibility\n\nResearchers look for people who fit a certain description, called eligibility criteria: person's general health condition or prior treatments.\n\nConditions\n\nCriteria\n\nAny sexBiological sex of participants that are eligible to enroll.\n\nFrom 2 to 70 YearsRange of ages for which participants are eligible to join.\n\nHealthy volunteers not allowedIf individuals who are healthy and do not have the condition being studied can participate.\n\n###### Conditions\n\nPathology\n\nCD19+ and CD 22+ B-ALL\n\n###### Criteria\n\n7 inclusion criteria required to participate\n\nSign the informed consent and be willing and able to comply with the visit, treatment regimen, laboratory examination and other requirements of the study as stipulated in the trial flow chart\n\n---\n\nA definite diagnosis of B-cell Lymphocyte Leukemia, which meets any of the following criteria: Relapsed : a) relapsed within 12 months after first remission;Refractory: a) no remission after six weeks of induction therapy or no remission after two courses of induction therapy; b) relapsedafter CR for 2 or more times; c) The first relapse after chemotherapy and no remission after at least one salvage treatment; c) relapsed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\n---\n\nECOG Scores: 0\\~2\n\n---\n\nCD19 positive and CD22 positive were detected by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry\n\n---\n\nShow More Criteria\n\n---\n\n10 exclusion criteria prevent from participating\n\nSerious cardiac insufficiency；\n\n---\n\nHas a history of severe pulmonary function damaging\n\n---\n\nPresence of other malignant tumors\n\n---\n\nPresence of active fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection requiring IV antibiotics for management\n\n---\n\nShow More Criteria\n\n---\n\n### Study Plan\n\nFind out more about all the medication administered in this study, their detailed description and what they involve.\n\nTreatment Groups\n\nStudy Objectives\n\nOne single intervention group\n\nis designated in this study\n\nThis study does not include a placebo group\n\n###### Treatment Groups\n\nGroup I\n\nExperimental\n\nEligible patients will be treated with SL19+22 CAR-T.\n\n###### Study Objectives\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\nTo evaluate the possible adverse events that could occurred within the first month post SL19+22 infusion, including symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.\n\nRemission Rate includes complete remission(CR)、CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)、No remission(NR)\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nDuration of response\n\nprogression-free survival (PFS) time\n\nthe copy number of CD19 and CD22 CAR- T cells in the genomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR).\n\nCytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry\n\n---\n\n### Study Centers\n\nThese are the hospitals, clinics, or research facilities where the trial is being conducted.
