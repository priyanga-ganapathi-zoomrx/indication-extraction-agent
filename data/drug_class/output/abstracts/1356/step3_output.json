      "reasoning": "After reviewing the 36 extraction rules and analyzing the evidence, I applied Rule 1 (Class Type Priority). The candidate 'C/EBPβ Antagonist' is a Mechanism of Action (MoA) class, while 'Immunomodulator' is a Therapeutic class. MoA has the highest priority in the hierarchy. Furthermore, 'C/EBPβ Antagonist' follows extraction Rule 11 and Rule 15 by including the specific biological target (C/EBPβ) and the modality (Antagonist) as supported by the abstract title evidence. Therefore, the more specific MoA class is selected over the broader therapeutic class."
