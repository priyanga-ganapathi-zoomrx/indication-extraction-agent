  "reasoning": "The title mentions 'antagonism of C/EBP?-dependent mesenchymal cell transition', but this describes a biological process/mechanism of action for the specific drug lucicebtide (ST101) rather than an explicit drug class. Per Rule 32 and Rule 36, drug classes must be explicitly stated as a modality (e.g., 'C/EBP Antagonist'). Since 'Antagonist' is used as a verb/process ('antagonism of...') and not as a standalone drug class label for the intervention, no drug class is extracted. Lucicebtide is a drug name, and its class is not to be inferred."
