• Identify whether ""Acute"" is directly attached to (or separated by no more than two stop-words such as “severe”, “complicated”, “exacerbation of”) a clinically accepted disease noun (e.g., pancreatitis, myeloid leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory distress syndrome).  
• If this adjacency test is met, keep ""Acute"" fused with the disease term exactly as it appears in the source text (capital “A”, single space separator) and output it as one complete indication (e.g., “Acute Pancreatitis”, “Acute Myeloid Leukemia”).  
• If multiple “Acute + Disease” entities are found, list each in the order encountered and separate them with “;;”.  
• If ""Acute"" does NOT meet the adjacency test—meaning it functions only as a temporal/severity adjective (e.g., “acute pain”, “acute toxicity”, “acute phase proteins”) or is not linked to a recognized disease noun—omit ""Acute"" and do not generate a corresponding indication, because it does not describe a distinct disease entity.

• Scan the text to determine whether the word “Primary” is immediately followed (within one token, allowing for optional punctuation such as a single hyphen or comma) by a proper-case disease name or standard disease phrase (e.g., “Primary Biliary Cholangitis”, “Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis”, “Primary Myelofibrosis”).  
• When this pattern is confirmed, concatenate “Primary” with the full succeeding disease term and output it as one complete indication in the form “Primary <Disease Name>” (retain original capitalization, no additional punctuation), treating the combined phrase as a single indication unit to be separated from other indications with the standard “;;” delimiter.  
• Do NOT generate an indication when “Primary” is:  
  – followed by non-disease words (e.g., “endpoint”, “tumor”, “site”, “care”, “outcome”),  
  – used in a different grammatical position (e.g., “biliary cholangitis, primary form”), or  
  – part of a general adjective phrase unrelated to a recognized disease entity.

25,Common Check points,Disease Characterisation,Secondary,**,When Secondary is followed by disease name,Secondary progressive MS cerebrospinal fluid induces axonal degeneration in human primary neurons,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,"If the input contains the keyword ""Secondary"" for medical indication formatting, apply contextual processing:  
• Special action: Treat ""Secondary"" as a disease-characterisation qualifier only when it is immediately followed (within the same noun phrase, ignoring commas or the word “progressive”) by a recognised disease term or its common abbreviation (e.g., “MS” → “Multiple Sclerosis”). Capture the entire phrase beginning with “Secondary” through the complete disease name, convert all recognised abbreviations to their full, title-cased form, and output it exactly as ""Secondary <Full-Disease-Name>"" (e.g., “Secondary progressive MS” → “Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis”).  
• Analysis requirement: Before applying, verify that the word “to” does NOT directly follow “Secondary” (e.g., “secondary to trauma” must be ignored) and that “Secondary” is not modifying non-disease words such as “endpoint,” “outcome,” or “analysis.” Retain a single space between words and terminate the resulting indication with the standard separator “;;” when concatenating with additional indications, to maintain consistent separation between multiple medical indications.",Success

1. Detection  
   • Match the phrase “second primary” (case-insensitive, allow optional intervening punctuation).  
   • Confirm that it is immediately followed (≤ 3 tokens) by a disease noun phrase (e.g., “esophageal cancer”, “lung carcinoma”, “melanoma”).  
   • Ignore occurrences where “second primary” is used without a specific disease reference or is used in purely descriptive context (e.g., “second primary endpoint”).  

2. Extraction & Standardisation  
   • Capture the entire disease noun phrase up to, but not including, any subsequent comma, semicolon, coordinating conjunction, or sentence-terminating punctuation.  
   • Normalise the disease phrase to standard tumour nomenclature:  
     – Convert organ adjectives to title case canonical form (e.g., “esophagus” → “Esophageal Cancer”, “colon carcinoma” → “Colon Cancer”).  
     – Remove adjectives such as “malignancy”, “neoplasm”, “tumor” unless part of the canonical name, replacing them with “Cancer” when appropriate.  
     – Retain histology qualifiers when clinically essential (e.g., “Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma”).  

3. Construction of the indication  
   • Concatenate the fixed prefix “Second Primary ” with the normalised disease phrase.  
   • Do not insert hyphens or additional punctuation.  
   • Example: “second primary malignancy of the esophagus” → “Second Primary Esophageal Cancer”.  

4. Multiples  
   • If more than one qualifying disease follows separate mentions of “second primary” within the same text, generate a separate indication for each and join them with “;;”.  

5. Output formatting  
   • Return the constructed indication(s) exactly as “Second Primary <Disease>”, in Title Case, with leading and trailing spaces trimmed, to maintain consistent separation between multiple medical indications.",Success

• Step 1 – Identify positional relationship  
  – Confirm that ""Early"" is immediately linked to a disease term (e.g., “early gastric cancer”, “early colorectal carcinoma”, “early‐onset Alzheimer’s disease”).  
  – Allow only whitespace, hyphen, or the words “onset” / “stage” / histological qualifiers (e.g., “gastric”) between “Early” and the disease name.  
  – Ignore occurrences where “Early” modifies non-disease concepts (e.g., “early detection”, “early postoperative”, “early phase trial”, “early response”).  

• Step 2 – Semantic validation  
  – Exclude if the phrase clearly refers to tumour stage (“early-stage lung cancer”) rather than age-of-onset.  
  – Include if the text conveys age-related onset or is ambiguous yet traditionally accepted as early-onset terminology (e.g., “early gastric cancer”).  

• Step 3 – Output construction  
  – Replace the original phrase with “Early Onset <Disease Name in Title Case>”.  
  – Remove words such as “stage”, “carcinoma vs. cancer” duplication, and any connecting punctuation.  
  – Examples:  
    • “early gastric cancer” → “Early Onset Gastric Cancer”  
    • “early-onset Alzheimer’s disease” → “Early Onset Alzheimer’s Disease”  

• Step 4 – Formatting  
  – Capitalise the first letters (Title Case).  
  – If multiple indications are generated, separate each with “;;”.  
  – Maintain one space between “Early Onset” and the disease name, ensuring no trailing punctuation, to ensure consistent medical terminology formatting.

This contextual processing requires semantic analysis of disease linkage versus non-disease temporal descriptors before applying the “Early Onset” transformation.",Success

   b. If “Postpartum” is immediately followed by, or hyphen-linked to, a disease term (e.g., “postpartum-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome”), strip the affix (“-associated/-related/-onset”) and render as “Postpartum <Disease>” (e.g., “Postpartum Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome”).

3. Indication construction  
   a. Women-Health/Pregnancy conferences:

  – Ignore occurrences where “Complement” describes laboratory values (e.g., “low complement levels”), genes/proteins (e.g., “complement C5”), or drug classes (e.g., “complement inhibitors”) without a disease name.  

• Action to perform:  
  1. Capture the exact linking term (“mediated”, “associated”, “dependent”) and the full disease phrase that follows, stopping at punctuation (, ; : .), a coordinating conjunction, or end of title/abstract segment.

 – If the modifier denotes normality (e.g., “normal complement”, “normal complement levels”, “within-normal complement”), DO NOT include any complement-related wording in the output indication, because a normal complement status does not define a clinically distinct patient sub-group.  
 – If the modifier denotes decrease or absence (e.g., “low complement”, “decreased complement”, “reduced complement”, “hypocomplementemia”, “complement deficiency”, “C3 deficiency”, “C4 deficiency”, “CH50 deficiency”), append a patient sub-group tag to the disease indication as follows:
