â€¢ Identify whether ""Acute"" is directly attached to (or separated by no more than two stop-words such as â€œsevereâ€, â€œcomplicatedâ€, â€œexacerbation ofâ€) a clinically accepted disease noun (e.g., pancreatitis, myeloid leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory distress syndrome).  
â€¢ If this adjacency test is met, keep ""Acute"" fused with the disease term exactly as it appears in the source text (capital â€œAâ€, single space separator) and output it as one complete indication (e.g., â€œAcute Pancreatitisâ€, â€œAcute Myeloid Leukemiaâ€).  
â€¢ If multiple â€œAcute + Diseaseâ€ entities are found, list each in the order encountered and separate them with â€œ;;â€.  
â€¢ If ""Acute"" does NOT meet the adjacency testâ€”meaning it functions only as a temporal/severity adjective (e.g., â€œacute painâ€, â€œacute toxicityâ€, â€œacute phase proteinsâ€) or is not linked to a recognized disease nounâ€”omit ""Acute"" and do not generate a corresponding indication, because it does not describe a distinct disease entity.

â€¢ Scan the text to determine whether the word â€œPrimaryâ€ is immediately followed (within one token, allowing for optional punctuation such as a single hyphen or comma) by a proper-case disease name or standard disease phrase (e.g., â€œPrimary Biliary Cholangitisâ€, â€œPrimary Sclerosing Cholangitisâ€, â€œPrimary Myelofibrosisâ€).  
â€¢ When this pattern is confirmed, concatenate â€œPrimaryâ€ with the full succeeding disease term and output it as one complete indication in the form â€œPrimary <Disease Name>â€ (retain original capitalization, no additional punctuation), treating the combined phrase as a single indication unit to be separated from other indications with the standard â€œ;;â€ delimiter.  
â€¢ Do NOT generate an indication when â€œPrimaryâ€ is:  
  â€“ followed by non-disease words (e.g., â€œendpointâ€, â€œtumorâ€, â€œsiteâ€, â€œcareâ€, â€œoutcomeâ€),  
  â€“ used in a different grammatical position (e.g., â€œbiliary cholangitis, primary formâ€), or  
  â€“ part of a general adjective phrase unrelated to a recognized disease entity.  

This rule therefore requires contextual analysis to confirm that â€œPrimaryâ€ functions as an integral component of a formally named disease before converting it into an output indication, ensuring precise and clinically valid medical indication formatting.",Success
25,Common Check points,Disease Characterisation,Secondary,**,When Secondary is followed by disease name,Secondary progressive MS cerebrospinal fluid induces axonal degeneration in human primary neurons,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,"If the input contains the keyword ""Secondary"" for medical indication formatting, apply contextual processing:  
â€¢ Special action: Treat ""Secondary"" as a disease-characterisation qualifier only when it is immediately followed (within the same noun phrase, ignoring commas or the word â€œprogressiveâ€) by a recognised disease term or its common abbreviation (e.g., â€œMSâ€ â†’ â€œMultiple Sclerosisâ€). Capture the entire phrase beginning with â€œSecondaryâ€ through the complete disease name, convert all recognised abbreviations to their full, title-cased form, and output it exactly as ""Secondary <Full-Disease-Name>"" (e.g., â€œSecondary progressive MSâ€ â†’ â€œSecondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosisâ€).  
â€¢ Analysis requirement: Before applying, verify that the word â€œtoâ€ does NOT directly follow â€œSecondaryâ€ (e.g., â€œsecondary to traumaâ€ must be ignored) and that â€œSecondaryâ€ is not modifying non-disease words such as â€œendpoint,â€ â€œoutcome,â€ or â€œanalysis.â€ Retain a single space between words and terminate the resulting indication with the standard separator â€œ;;â€ when concatenating with additional indications, to maintain consistent separation between multiple medical indications.",Success

1. Detection  
   â€¢ Match the phrase â€œsecond primaryâ€ (case-insensitive, allow optional intervening punctuation).  
   â€¢ Confirm that it is immediately followed (â‰¤ 3 tokens) by a disease noun phrase (e.g., â€œesophageal cancerâ€, â€œlung carcinomaâ€, â€œmelanomaâ€).  
   â€¢ Ignore occurrences where â€œsecond primaryâ€ is used without a specific disease reference or is used in purely descriptive context (e.g., â€œsecond primary endpointâ€).  

2. Extraction & Standardisation  
   â€¢ Capture the entire disease noun phrase up to, but not including, any subsequent comma, semicolon, coordinating conjunction, or sentence-terminating punctuation.  
   â€¢ Normalise the disease phrase to standard tumour nomenclature:  
     â€“ Convert organ adjectives to title case canonical form (e.g., â€œesophagusâ€ â†’ â€œEsophageal Cancerâ€, â€œcolon carcinomaâ€ â†’ â€œColon Cancerâ€).  
     â€“ Remove adjectives such as â€œmalignancyâ€, â€œneoplasmâ€, â€œtumorâ€ unless part of the canonical name, replacing them with â€œCancerâ€ when appropriate.  
     â€“ Retain histology qualifiers when clinically essential (e.g., â€œDiffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomaâ€).  

3. Construction of the indication  
   â€¢ Concatenate the fixed prefix â€œSecond Primary â€ with the normalised disease phrase.  
   â€¢ Do not insert hyphens or additional punctuation.  
   â€¢ Example: â€œsecond primary malignancy of the esophagusâ€ â†’ â€œSecond Primary Esophageal Cancerâ€.  

4. Multiples  
   â€¢ If more than one qualifying disease follows separate mentions of â€œsecond primaryâ€ within the same text, generate a separate indication for each and join them with â€œ;;â€.  

5. Output formatting  
   â€¢ Return the constructed indication(s) exactly as â€œSecond Primary <Disease>â€, in Title Case, with leading and trailing spaces trimmed, to maintain consistent separation between multiple medical indications.",Success

   â€¢ Stop the capture when any of the following delimiters is reached: comma, semicolon, colon, full stop, â€œ/â€, â€œ&â€, the words â€œandâ€ or â€œwithâ€, or a new line.  
   â€¢ If an abbreviation in parentheses immediately follows the full term (e.g., â€œesophageal (E)â€), discard the parenthetical content.  
   â€¢ Retain histology words such as â€œadenocarcinomaâ€, â€œcarcinomaâ€, â€œcancerâ€, â€œsarcomaâ€, etc., if they are part of the captured phrase.  
   â€¢ Convert the first letter of each significant word in the captured phrase to uppercase (Title Case); leave recognised histology words in their standard form (e.g., â€œAdenocarcinomaâ€).  

3. Output construction  
   â€¢ For every distinct disease phrase captured, prepend the normalised keyword and a single space to form â€œLoco Regional <Disease Phrase>â€.  
   â€¢ When more than one disease phrase is present (e.g., linked by â€œandâ€ or â€œ/â€), generate a separate indication for each and join them using the standard separator â€œ;;â€.  
   â€¢ Do not add a trailing separator.  

4. Edge-case handling  
   â€¢ Ignore duplicate disease phrases that differ only by pluralisation or abbreviation.  
   â€¢ If the keyword appears in a context unrelated to cancer staging (e.g., â€œloco-regional anesthesiaâ€), do not apply this rule.

â€¢ If yes, prepend the term â€œEarly Onsetâ€ (capitalised, single space between the words) to the disease indication; position it immediately before any other modifiers (e.g., receptor status, mutation, stage).  
â€¢ If ""Early"" instead refers to something other than disease onsetâ€”such as early-phase/early-line trial design, early assessment, early toxicity, or early treatment responseâ€”omit the word entirely from the output indication.  
â€¢ When â€œEarly Onsetâ€ is added, keep standard indication formatting: separate multiple indications with â€œ;;â€, avoid hyphens, and do not abbreviate.

  â€“ Confirm that ""Early"" is immediately linked to a disease term (e.g., â€œearly gastric cancerâ€, â€œearly colorectal carcinomaâ€, â€œearlyâ€onset Alzheimerâ€™s diseaseâ€).  
  â€“ Allow only whitespace, hyphen, or the words â€œonsetâ€ / â€œstageâ€ / histological qualifiers (e.g., â€œgastricâ€) between â€œEarlyâ€ and the disease name.  
  â€“ Ignore occurrences where â€œEarlyâ€ modifies non-disease concepts (e.g., â€œearly detectionâ€, â€œearly postoperativeâ€, â€œearly phase trialâ€, â€œearly responseâ€).  

â€¢ Step 2 â€“ Semantic validation  
  â€“ Exclude if the phrase clearly refers to tumour stage (â€œearly-stage lung cancerâ€) rather than age-of-onset.  
  â€“ Include if the text conveys age-related onset or is ambiguous yet traditionally accepted as early-onset terminology (e.g., â€œearly gastric cancerâ€).  

â€¢ Step 3 â€“ Output construction  
  â€“ Replace the original phrase with â€œEarly Onset <Disease Name in Title Case>â€.
