1356,Use of lucicebtide (ST101) in glioblastoma patients by antagonism of C/EBP?-dependent mesenchymal cell transition and immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization.,Sapience Therapeutics,"Background: C/EBP? is a master regulator of the mesenchymal phenotype in GBM and has an essential role in the maintenance of immunosuppressive M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Lucicebtide is a first-in-class antagonist of C/EBP? that has shown direct anti-tumor activity in GBM as well as the ability to reprogram TAMs in the TME toward immunostimulatory M1 macrophages. In a recent recurrent GBM (rGBM) P2 study, lucicebtide was well-tolerated and resulted in disease control in 9/30 patients, including two PRs lasting > 1 year. With strong rationale for targeting C/EBP? in GBM, additional cohorts we explored in a window-of-opportunity (WoO) study (NCT04478279). Methods: The WoO study enrolled 2 cohorts; 9 pts with rGBM that received 2-4 doses of lucicebtide 500mg QW prior to surgery and resumed lucicebtide after surgery to progression and 9 ndGBM pts that received 2-3 doses of lucicebtide 500mg QW prior to surgery and resumed lucicebtide + chemoradiation after surgery until progression. Endpoints include efficacy parameters of PFS and OS, safety as a single agent and in combination with chemoradiation, and pharmacodynamic analyses including spatial transcriptomics and TME characterization. Results: Lucicebtide was well-tolerated as a single agent and in combination with chemoradiation. Tissue analysis indicates penetration past the BBB and tumor uptake, as well as C/EBP? target engagement. Lucicebtide + chemoradiation in ndGBM extended PFS beyond historic benchmarks, with the majority of patients remaining on study without progression (7-22+ months). As of January 25, 2025, mOS could not be evaluated, with 8/9 patients alive. In rGBM, lucicebtide improved mPFS to 3.4 months and mOS to at least 11.8 months, exceeding historical data with chemotherapy (historic mPFS ~ 2 months and mOS 5.6-9.8 months). Pathologic evidence of treatment effect, i.e. geographic necrosis, was observed in 5/6 pts including otherwise treatment naïve ndGBM patients. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed a significant reduction in the mesenchymal gene signature following lucicebtide, consistent with on-target antagonism of C/EBP?. Further, immune activation in the TME, as indicated by increased M1/M2 ratio and CD8+ T cell infiltration, was associated with disease control. Conclusions: Lucicebtide is well-tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with SoC. Improvements in PFS and OS in GBM patients following lucicebtide exposure demonstrated penetration across the BBB and target engagement, resulting in on-target pharmacodynamic activity including a dramatic reduction in mesenchymal gene signature in tumor cells and a remodeling towards a more permissive immune TME. These data provide the mechanistic rationale for continued clinical evaluation of lucicebtide as a novel approach for patients with GBM.","{

  ""reasoning"": ""Step 1: The abstract title contains the disease term 'glioblastoma', so it is selected as the source based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle.\nStep 2: The term 'glioblastoma' was identified as the core disease component. Other phrases like 'mesenchymal cell transition' and 'immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization' are biological processes, not diagnosable diseases, and are excluded based on the generic exclusion rules for non-diagnostic items.\nStep 3: No specific rules needed to be retrieved as 'glioblastoma' is a standard disease term.\nStep 4: The generic formatting rules were applied, converting 'glioblastoma' to 'Glioblastoma' (Title Case). The term is already in singular form.\nStep 5: The final indication was constructed from the single, normalized disease component."",
