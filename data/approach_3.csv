1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title 'Surgical Quality For Patients (Pts) Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Vs Chemoradiation For Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (Larc): Prospect (Ncctg N1048, Alliance)' contains a specific disease term ('Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer'). The session title 'Colorectal Cancer' is less specific. Based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle, the abstract title is selected as the source.
2. **Identify Components**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'Rectal Cancer' and the stage descriptor 'Locally Advanced'. The phrase 'Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Vs Chemoradiation' is identified as a treatment context.
3. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: Rules for 'Stage' and 'Treatment Set-up' were retrieved to handle 'Locally Advanced' and the treatment context, respectively.
4. **Apply Rules**:
   - **Generic Exclusion Rule**: The procedural qualifier 'Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Vs Chemoradiation' is excluded as per the generic rules.
   - **Stage Rule Principle**: Although no specific rule for 'Locally Advanced' was found, the pattern from other stage rules (e.g., 'Limited Stage', 'Extensive Stage') indicates that such descriptors should be kept and prepended to the disease name.
   - **Formatting Rules**: The indication is converted to Title Case and singular form. 'Rectal Cancer' is already singular.
5. **Construct Indication**: The stage 'Locally Advanced' is combined with the disease 'Rectal Cancer' to form the final indication.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title was chosen over the session title because it contains a more specific disease term, 'Myelofibrosis (Mf)', compared to the broader 'Myeloproliferative Neoplasms' in the session title. This adheres to the single-source principle.

2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title contains two distinct patient populations for the disease 'Myelofibrosis':
    *   Patients receiving therapy as 'First-Line'.
    *   Patients treated 'After Prior Ruxolitinib'.

3.  **Rule Retrieval and Application**:
    *   For the 'First-Line' component, I retrieved rules for 'Line of treatment'. The rules (e.g., ID: 198, 200) state that when 'first-line' modifies a therapy or disease concept (as in 'First-Line Myelofibrosis...Therapy'), it should be retained, standardized to 'First-Line', and placed at the beginning of the indication. This leads to the first indication: `First-Line Myelofibrosis`.
    *   For the 'After Prior Ruxolitinib' component, this phrase describes a patient's treatment history. This is a specific instance of a 'Previously Treated' patient subgroup. Rules for 'Treatment Status' confirm that such descriptors should be included. Therefore, this cohort is normalized to `Previously Treated Myelofibrosis`.

4.  **Indication Construction**: The title explicitly separates these two populations with 'And', indicating two distinct groups are being analyzed. Therefore, two separate indications are generated and combined using the ';;' delimiter as required.

5.  **Final Quality Check**: Generic rules were applied. The disease term 'Myelofibrosis' is singular and in Title Case. Procedural details like drug names ('Fedratinib', 'Ruxolitinib') and trial names ('Jakarta', 'Jakarta2') were correctly excluded.

    a. 'RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder'
    b. 'Myeloid Malignancies'
    c. 'Clonal Hematopoiesis'
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: Rules were retrieved for handling multiple diseases, familial qualifiers, and gene names.
    - `Patient with two different Disease`: No specific rule for the connector 'with' was found, defaulting to the generic rule of separating distinct diseases with ';;'.
    - `Patient Sub-Group` for 'Familial': The rules confirm that 'Familial' should be retained as a prefix to the disease it modifies.
    - `Gene Name` for 'RUNX1': The rules indicate that a gene name alone is insufficient, but here 'RUNX1' is an integral part of the specific disorder's name ('RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder'), not a standalone biomarker, so it must be retained.
4.  **Rule Application and Construction**:
    - **Indication 1**: 'RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder' was kept as is, correctly formatted in Title Case with the gene name preserved.
    - **Indication 2**: 'Myeloid Malignancies' was processed using the generic rule for singularization, converting 'Malignancies' to 'Malignancy', resulting in 'Myeloid Malignancy'.

2.  **Component Identification**: I identified the following key components in the abstract title: 'Adult' (age group), 'AML' (disease), 'Tandem Duplications of the UBTF gene' (genetic alteration), and 'Myelodysplasia' (associated condition).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category to correctly handle the 'Adult' descriptor.
4.  **Component Analysis and Normalization**:
    *   **Disease**: 'AML' was expanded to its full form 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia' and converted to singular Title Case.
    *   **Age Group**: Based on the retrieved 'Adult' rule (ID: 289), the term 'Adult' was prepended to the indication.
    *   **Genetic Alteration**: 'Tandem Duplications of the UBTF gene' was standardized to 'UBTF Tandem Duplication'. The gene symbol 'UBTF' is kept in its original uppercase form, and the alteration is formatted in Title Case. This component acts as a primary qualifier for the disease.
    *   **Associated Condition**: 'Myelodysplasia' was considered. However, the phrasing 'Associated with Myelodysplasia' indicates it is a characteristic or outcome of the primary disease cohort (Adult AML with UBTF duplication) rather than a separate, parallel indication being studied. Therefore, it was excluded from the final indication string to maintain focus on the core patient group.
    *   **Occurrence**: The term 'Recurrent Alteration' was identified. This describes the nature of the genetic finding itself (i.e., it is a commonly recurring mutation in the population) rather than the patient's disease status (e.g., relapsed/refractory). Thus, it was not included as a disease state qualifier like 'Recurrent'.

   - The context 'age-associated' and 'aging' was interpreted as representing an elderly patient population. Based on the pattern from retrieved rules for similar terms, this was standardized to the prefix 'Elderly'.
   - The phrase 'mouse model' was excluded as it refers to the study methodology (a pre-clinical model) and not a clinically valid human indication.
5. **Indication Construction**: The standardized age group 'Elderly' was prepended to the normalized disease name to form the final indication.
6. **Final Quality Check**: The resulting indication 'Elderly Clostridioides Difficile Infection' adheres to all formatting and content rules.

By extension, 'Monoallelic' was also excluded as it falls under the same category of non-standard descriptors.
    *   **Genetic Origin**: Rules for 'Occurrence' -> 'Genetic Origin' were retrieved for 'Germline'. Rule ID 180 specifies retaining 'Germline' and placing it after the standardized gene-mutation token (e.g., '<Gene>-Mutated Germline').
    *   **Gene Mutation**: Following standard gene mutation rules, 'Mutations Affecting... Helios' is normalized to 'Helios-Mutated'.

4.  **Rule Application & Normalization**:
    *   **Disease**: 'High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (Hgsoc)' was normalized. The abbreviation '(Hgsoc)' was removed. 'Cancer' is already in singular form. 'Serous' is a key histological subtype and was retained.
    *   **Grade**: Based on the retrieved 'Grade' rules (e.g., ID 115), 'High-Grade' was normalized to 'High Grade'.
    *   **Stage**: 'Figo Stage Iiic/Iv' was standardized. The staging system 'Figo' was dropped in favor of the standard format. The Roman numerals were capitalized and combined, resulting in 'Stage IIIC/IV', consistent with staging rules.
    *   **Exclusions**: The sociodemographic descriptor 'Women' was excluded as per generic rules. The phrase 'Diagnosed With' was excluded as a procedural qualifier.

4. **Rule Application and Normalization**:
    - **Disease**: The term 'Leukemia' is already in singular form and was converted to Title Case.
    - **Gene Information**: The term 'KMT2A-rearranged' was normalized to 'KMT2A-Rearranged' based on the retrieved 'Gene Rearranged' rule (ID 48), which specifies the format '<Gene>-Rearranged'.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title 'Circulating tumour DNA for monitoring of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high grade serous ovarian carcinoma' was chosen as it contains a specific disease, 'high grade serous ovarian carcinoma', which is more precise than the therapeutic area 'oncology' mentioned in the session title.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title were 'high grade' (Grade), 'serous' (Histological Subtype), and 'ovarian carcinoma' (Disease).
3. **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting, I retrieved rules for the 'Grade' category, specifically for 'High Grade'. I also retrieved rules for 'Treatment Set-up' to determine how to handle 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The retrieved rule for 'High Grade' (ID: 115) dictates standardizing the term to 'High Grade' with leading capitals and no hyphen.
   - No specific rule was found for including 'neoadjuvant'. Therefore, per the generic exclusion rules for procedural/temporal qualifiers, 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy' was excluded as it describes a treatment setting rather than a core part of the indication.
   - The generic rule for singular form was applied, although 'carcinoma' is already singular.

3. **Indication Extraction & Normalization**:
   - **'UTI Biofilms'**: 'UTI' is a standard abbreviation for 'Urinary Tract Infection', which is a valid disease. 'Biofilms' is a microbiological process, not a patient subgroup or part of the disease name, and was excluded based on the generic rule to exclude non-diagnostic items.
   - **'Amyloid'**: In a clinical context alongside other diseases, 'Amyloid' is interpreted as the disease 'Amyloidosis'.
   - **'Lupus Flares'**: 'Lupus' is a valid disease. 'Flares' describes a temporary state of disease activity and is not a standard qualifier for a clinical indication. Therefore, it was excluded, and the core disease 'Lupus' was extracted.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title ('A Chemotherapy-Free Combination Of Ponatinib And Blinatumomab For Patients With Newly Diagnosed Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Subgroup Analysis From A Phase Ii Study') contains a specific disease and patient subgroup. The session title ('Clinical updates in ALL') is more general. Based on the single-source principle, the abstract title is selected for extraction as it is more detailed.
2. **Identify Components**: The key components identified in the abstract title are 'Newly Diagnosed' (Diagnosis Status), 'Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive' (Genetic Marker), and 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' (Disease).
3. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: I retrieved rules for the 'Diagnosis Status' component.

2.  **Component Identification**: I identified three key components in the abstract title: the disease ('Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma'), a disease state ('Relapsed or Refractory'), and a treatment line ('Second-Line Therapy').
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting, I retrieved rules for 'Line of treatment' and 'Recurrent/Refractory' categories.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Treatment Line**: Based on the retrieved 'Line of treatment' rules (specifically Rule ID 199 and 202), the phrase 'Second-Line Therapy for...' indicates that 'Second-Line' modifies the disease context, not a specific drug. Therefore, it must be retained and normalized to 'Second-Line'.
    *   **Disease State**: The phrase 'Relapsed or Refractory' is a standard patient subgroup descriptor. It is normalized to 'Relapsed/Refractory' with a slash, following common clinical terminology standards.

2. **Select Source**: Based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle, the session title is selected as it is the only source containing a valid disease term.
3. **Identify Components**: From the session title, the components are 'Aggressive' (a disease characterization) and 'Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma' (the core disease). The term 'Clinical' is a session descriptor and not part of the indication.
4. **Retrieve Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Disease Characterisation' and 'Risk Types' to determine how to handle the term 'Aggressive'.

3. **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Grade' category were retrieved to handle 'High Grade'. Rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' were retrieved to check for handling of descriptors like 'Double and Triple Hit'.
4. **Rule Application**:
   - The retrieved rule for 'High Grade' (ID: 115) confirmed its standardization and placement before the disease name.
   - No specific rule was found for 'Double and Triple Hit', so it was retained as an essential clinical descriptor defining the patient subgroup.
   - Generic exclusion rules were applied to remove 'Patients' (sociodemographic) and 'Treated with DA-EPOCH' (procedural qualifier).
   - Generic formatting rules were applied: Title Case for clinical terms ('Double', 'Triple', 'Hit', 'High', 'Grade', 'B', 'Cell', 'Lymphoma') and lowercase for the conjunction 'and'. The disease term 'Lymphoma' is already in its singular form.
5. **Indication Construction**: The identified and standardized components were combined in the correct clinical order (subgroup -> grade -> disease) to form the final indication: 'Double and Triple Hit High Grade B Cell Lymphoma'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('How does the type of urinary diversion affect health related quality of life (HRQOL) in the course of four years after radical cystectomy? - A propensity score-matched analysis') does not contain a disease term, only a surgical procedure ('radical cystectomy'). The session title ('MP03: Bladder Cancer: Invasive I') explicitly mentions 'Bladder Cancer'. Therefore, according to the single-source principle, the session title is selected for extraction.
2.  **Component Identification**: From the session title, the core disease is 'Bladder Cancer' and the key qualifier is 'Invasive'. The terms 'MP03' and 'I' are session identifiers and are excluded.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' under the 'Disease Characterisation' subcategory to check for specific handling of terms like 'Invasive'. While no specific rule for 'Invasive' was found, the general principle is to include clinically significant descriptors.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    - The generic rule for Title Casing is applied, resulting in 'Invasive Bladder Cancer'.
    - The generic rule for singular form is applied; 'Bladder Cancer' is already singular.
    - 'Invasive' is a standard clinical descriptor for cancer that specifies its behavior (spreading into surrounding tissue) and is crucial for defining the patient subgroup. It is therefore prepended to the disease name.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Ordered and selective patterns of cancer genome evolution revealed by lineage tracing of sporadic p53 loss') was chosen over the session title because it contains a specific genetic event ('p53 loss') linked to a disease ('cancer'), making it more specific.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'cancer' and the genetic event 'p53 loss'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Gene type' category were retrieved to correctly handle the genetic event 'p53 loss'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The disease term 'cancer' was normalized to 'Cancer' using the generic Title Case and singular form rules.
   - The genetic event 'p53 loss' was processed. The gene 'p53' is standardized to its official HGNC symbol 'TP53'. The term 'loss' is handled by rules for gene depletion/deficiency (e.g., Rule ID 76 for 'Gene Depleted' which covers 'loss of'). This transforms 'TP53 loss' into the standardized format 'TP53-Depleted'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('State of the art first-line management of patients with advanced RCC') was chosen over the session title because it contains a specific disease term ('RCC') and provides a complete context for the indication. The Single-Source Extraction Principle dictates using the abstract title first.
2.  **Component Identification**: I identified three key components in the abstract title: 'first-line' (treatment line), 'advanced' (disease stage), and 'RCC' (disease).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Stage', 'Treatment Set-up', and 'Patient Sub-Group' to correctly handle these components.
4.  **Component Normalization & Rule Application**:
    *   **Disease**: 'RCC' is a standard medical acronym for 'Renal Cell Carcinoma'. This was expanded and normalized to 'Renal Cell Carcinoma' in Title Case, following generic formatting rules.
    *   **Stage**: The term 'advanced' was identified as a stage descriptor. Based on staging rules, it is prepended to the disease name and formatted as 'Advanced'.
    *   **Treatment Line**: The term 'first-line' modifies 'management', which is a generic term. According to the retrieved 'Line of treatment' rules (specifically Rule ID 199 and 200), when a line descriptor is not followed by a specific drug name, it should be retained, normalized to 'First-Line', and placed at the beginning of the indication.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The normalized components were assembled in the correct clinical order: Treatment Line -> Stage -> Disease. This resulted in 'First-Line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma'.
6.  **Exclusion**: Non-diagnostic phrases like 'State of the art', 'management of', and 'patients with' were excluded as per the generic exclusion rules.

    *   To handle 'Previously Treated' and 'Adjuvant', rules for 'Treatment Set-up' (subcategory 'Treatment Status') were retrieved.

4.  **Rule Application**:
    *   **Line of Treatment ('First-Line')**: Rule 199 ('Treatment Set-up') states that line-of-treatment descriptors like 'first-line' should be excluded when immediately followed by a specific drug name. In the title, 'First-Line' is followed by 'Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab'. Therefore, 'First-Line' is excluded from the indication.
    *   **Patient History ('Previously Treated With Adjuvant Systemic Therapy')**: The generic exclusion rule for 'Procedural/Temporal Qualifiers' mandates the removal of terms describing treatment history like 'previously treated'. Additionally, Rule 209 ('Treatment Set-up') specifically requires excluding 'Adjuvant'. The entire phrase 'Previously Treated With Adjuvant Systemic Therapy' is therefore excluded.
    *   **Stage ('Advanced')**: 'Advanced' is a standard clinical stage descriptor and is retained.
    *   **Disease ('Melanoma')**: The core disease term is retained.
    *   **Formatting**: The components are combined and formatted according to generic rules: 'Advanced' + 'Melanoma' -> 'Advanced Melanoma'. Title Case is applied, and the term is already singular.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('A Novel Approach Of Dual Metagenomics Next-Generation Sequencing For Early Diagnosis Of Blood Stream Infection In Hematologic Patients With Febrile Neutropenia: A Multicenter, Prospective Study') was chosen over the session title ('Infections and SCT complications') because it contains specific, well-defined medical conditions, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title clearly identifies two distinct medical conditions: 'Blood Stream Infection' and 'Febrile Neutropenia'. The term 'Hematologic Patients' describes the patient population but is a broad descriptor of a patient type rather than a specific disease qualifier, so it is excluded based on the principle of creating concise, disease-focused indications.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I initiated a search for rules related to handling multiple diseases ('Patient with two different Disease') and patient characterization ('Patient Sub-Group'). No specific rule for combining these particular conditions was found, so I proceeded with the generic rules.
4.  **Rule Application**: The generic rule for 'Multiple Diseases' was applied. This rule mandates that if a title mentions multiple distinct diseases, all should be extracted and separated by a double semicolon (';;').

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Mechanisms of Kidney Injury and Lower Endowment in the Extreme Preterm') was chosen as the source because it contains a specific medical condition ('Kidney Injury'), whereas the session title ('Maternal and Environmental Factors: Effect on Kidney Formation and Function') describes physiological processes rather than a distinct disease.
2.  **Component Identification**: From the abstract title, two key components were identified: the disease 'Kidney Injury' and the patient subgroup 'Extreme Preterm'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category to determine how to handle terms like 'Preterm'. While no specific rule for 'Extreme Preterm' was found, the general principle from related rules (e.g., for 'Pediatric', 'Neonatal') is to retain clinically significant age-based subgroups as a prefix to the disease.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Biomarker' category to determine how to handle 'Pd-L1'.
4.  **Rule Application**: The retrieved rules (e.g., Rule ID 83 for Anti-PD-1) and general principles indicate that biomarkers should only be included if they define a specific patient subgroup (e.g., 'PD-L1-Positive'). In this title, 'Pd-L1' is the subject of an 'Evaluation Of The Transcriptomic Presence', not a pre-defined characteristic of the patient cohort. Therefore, it is excluded from the indication. The other terms like 'Tumor Associated Antigens (Taas)' and 'Antibody Drug Conjugates (Adcs)' are also part of the study's methodology and not part of the core disease definition.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title describes medical procedures ('urine cultures', 'cystoscopies', 'ureteral reimplantation') but does not name a disease or condition. The session title, 'MP17: Pediatric Urology: Upper & Lower Urinary Tract', contains a clear patient subgroup ('Pediatric') and anatomical areas of focus ('Upper & Lower Urinary Tract') within a therapeutic area ('Urology'). According to the single-source principle, the session title is selected as it contains actionable indication components.
2. **Component Identification**: From the session title, the following components were identified: 'Pediatric' (age group), 'Upper Urinary Tract' (anatomical location 1), and 'Lower Urinary Tract' (anatomical location 2).
3. **Rule Retrieval**: The presence of 'Pediatric' prompted the retrieval of rules for the 'Age Group' category to ensure correct formatting.
4. **Rule Application**: The retrieved rules for 'Pediatric' (e.g., Rule ID 295) confirm that it should be used as a prefix for the indication. The phrase 'Upper & Lower Urinary Tract' clearly indicates two separate anatomical regions. To create clinically valid indications from these anatomical sites within a urology context, the general term 'Disease' is appended to each.
5. **Indication Construction**: The components are assembled into two distinct indications: 'Pediatric Upper Urinary Tract Disease' and 'Pediatric Lower Urinary Tract Disease'.
6. **Final Formatting**: As per the generic rules for multiple diseases, the two indications are combined into a single string, separated by ';;'.

4. **Rule Application**:
   - The generic rule for singular form was applied, although 'melanoma' is already singular.
   - The generic rule for Title Case was applied, converting 'metastatic melanoma' to 'Metastatic Melanoma'.
   - The retrieved rule for 'Metastatic' (ID: 141) confirmed the format 'Metastatic <Disease>'.
   - The retrieved rules for 'Resistance' (ID: 164, 165) explicitly state that drug resistance (e.g., 'resistant...to BRAF/MEK inhibitors') should be excluded from the final indication as it describes a treatment response status, not a core disease entity.
5. **Indication Construction**: Based on the rules, the 'resistant' component was excluded, and the 'metastatic' component was combined with the disease to form the final indication.

    *   **Treatment Set-up Rule (ID: 207)**: This rule explicitly states that references to 'Prior Lines' of therapy should be excluded from the final indication as they describe treatment history, not a core indication qualifier. Therefore, the entire phrase 'Who Have Received at Least Two Prior Lines of Therapy Including Lenalidomide and a Proteasome Inhibitor' was removed.
    *   **Generic Rules**: The disease term 'Multiple Myeloma' was already in singular form. The final output was formatted to Title Case.

   - `get_indication_rules(category=""Treatment Set-up"", subcategories=[""Resectable""])` was used for 'Resectable'. Rule ID 236 confirmed that 'Resectable' should be included as a prefix.
4. **Apply Rules & Construct Indication**:
   - **Generic Rules**: The disease 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer' is already in singular form. Title Case is applied to all components. The parenthetical abbreviation '(Nsclc)' is removed as it's redundant.
   - **Stage Rule**: 'Stage I-Iii' is normalized to 'Stage I-III' for standardized representation, using Roman numerals as is standard for cancer staging.

2.  **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title were the disease 'Cancer' and the patient subgroup 'Older Adults'. The phrase 'Living with and After' was identified as a descriptor of the patient's journey rather than a standard clinical qualifier for an indication, and thus was excluded.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To standardize the patient subgroup, I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Elderly' and 'Older adult' terms.
4.  **Rule Application**: Based on the retrieved rules (specifically Rule ID 331), the term 'Older Adults' is normalized to the singular, title-case form 'Older Adult'. The disease term 'Cancer' is already in the correct singular and title-case format.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title is 'A Pilot Study of Outcomes after Robot-Assisted Sigmoid Vaginoplasty for Gender Dysphoria' and the session title is 'MP20: Trauma/Reconstruction/Diversion: External Genitalia Reconstruction and Urotrauma (including transgender surgery) I'.
2. **Select Source**: The abstract title contains a specific, clinically valid medical condition, 'Gender Dysphoria'. According to the single-source principle, the abstract title is prioritized over the session title.
3. **Identify Components**: The key components in the abstract title are the condition 'Gender Dysphoria' and the procedural context 'after Robot-Assisted Sigmoid Vaginoplasty'.
4. **Retrieve and Apply Rules**: 
   - The generic exclusion rules state that procedural and temporal qualifiers, such as 'post-surgery' or terms describing a procedure a patient has undergone, must be excluded. The phrase 'after Robot-Assisted Sigmoid Vaginoplasty' falls into this category.
   - To confirm this, rules for 'Operative Status' were retrieved. Rule ID 255 for 'Post Operative' confirms that such surgical-timing descriptors should be excluded from the final indication.
   - The core medical condition 'Gender Dysphoria' is retained.
5. **Construct Indication**: After excluding the procedural context, the remaining term is 'Gender Dysphoria'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Impact of Primary Kidney Disease on the Effects of Empagliflozin in Patients with CKD') was chosen over the session title ('Interventions to Reduce CKD Progression') because it is more specific and contains the core disease terms for the study population, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title explicitly mentions two distinct medical conditions: 'Primary Kidney Disease' and 'CKD' (Chronic Kidney Disease).
3.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Multiple Diseases Rule**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, which states that if a title mentions multiple distinct diseases, all should be extracted and separated by ';;'. The structure 'Impact of [Disease A] in Patients with [Disease B]' is analogous to the example 'Outcomes in [Disease A] with [Factor B]', leading to the extraction of both conditions.
    *   **Formatting Rules**: Standard formatting rules were applied. 'Primary Kidney Disease' is already in Title Case and singular. 'CKD' is a standard medical acronym and is maintained in its original uppercase form.
    *   **Exclusion Rules**: No terms requiring exclusion (e.g., sociodemographics, procedural qualifiers) were present in the title.
4.  **Indication Construction**: The identified diseases, 'Primary Kidney Disease' and 'CKD', were combined using the ';;' separator to form the final indication.

2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'Thalassemia' and the patient subgroup 'Children'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Pediatric', were retrieved to determine the correct handling of the term 'Children'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The generic exclusion rule was applied to remove procedural context, specifically 'Gvhd Prophylaxis' and 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation'.
   - The retrieved 'Age Group' rules (ID 295, 296) mandate normalizing age-related terms like 'Children' to the standard form 'Pediatric' and placing it at the beginning of the indication.
   - The generic casing rule was applied to ensure the final indication is in Title Case.
   - The generic singular form rule was applied, although 'Thalassemia' is already singular.
5. **Indication Construction**: The normalized age group 'Pediatric' was prepended to the disease 'Thalassemia' to form the final indication.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title contains the term ""benign disease"", which is a valid but extremely generic disease category. The session title, ""Trauma/Reconstruction/Diversion: Urethral Reconstruction (including Stricture, Diverticulum) I"", provides multiple specific and clinically valid conditions: ""Trauma"", ""Urethral Stricture"", and ""Urethral Diverticulum"". According to the goal of extracting clinically valid indications, the session title is the superior source in this case.
2.  **Component Identification**: From the session title, three distinct medical conditions were identified: 'Trauma', 'Stricture', and 'Diverticulum'. The anatomical location 'Urethral' is associated with 'Stricture' and 'Diverticulum'. The terms 'Reconstruction' and 'Diversion' are procedural and are excluded based on generic rules.
3.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring the use of ';;' as a separator.
    *   The generic rule for Title Case was applied to all terms.
    *   The generic rule for singular form was applied (all terms were already singular).
4.  **Indication Construction**: The identified components were combined and formatted. 'Urethral' was prepended to 'Stricture' and 'Diverticulum' as it provides the anatomical context. The final indications are 'Trauma', 'Urethral Stricture', and 'Urethral Diverticulum'.

2.  **Select Source**: Neither the abstract title nor the session title contains a specific disease or disorder. Both refer to a medical procedure ('Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation' and 'Autologous Transplantation'). The abstract title contains a patient subgroup ('over 75 Years Old') and a sociodemographic descriptor ('Minority Population').
3.  **Identify Components & Retrieve Rules**: 
    *   'over 75 Years Old' was identified as an age-based patient subgroup. I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, which confirmed that such phrases are typically normalized to 'Elderly'.
    *   'Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation' was identified as a procedure. I retrieved rules for 'Treatment Set-up' which confirmed that transplant-related terms are procedural and should be excluded.
    *   'Minority Population' is a sociodemographic descriptor and must be excluded based on generic rules.
4.  **Apply Rules & Construct Indication**: According to the 'Handling Orphan PSUBs' rule, a patient subgroup cannot form an indication without a core disease term from the same source.

The abstract title, 'Outcomes Associated with Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Real-World Analysis Using a Global Federated Database', and the session title, 'Kidney Transplantation: New Translational Insights', both revolve around the concept of 'Kidney Transplant'.

Step 2: I identified 'Kidney Transplant Recipients' and 'Kidney Transplantation' as the key patient population descriptors.

Step 3: To determine how to handle these terms, I used the `get_indication_rules` tool for the category 'Treatment Set-up' and subcategory 'Transplant Status'.

Step 4: The retrieved rules (e.g., Rule ID 232 for 'Post-Transplant') clearly state that transplant-related statuses should be excluded from the final indication because they describe a procedural or temporal status rather than a distinct clinical disease entity. The generic exclusion rules also state to exclude 'Procedural/Temporal Qualifiers'.

Step 5: Applying this rule, I must exclude 'Kidney Transplant Recipients' from the abstract title and 'Kidney Transplantation' from the session title.

- The abstract_title is 'IFNg-Induced APOL1 Expression and Pyroptotic Angiopathy in Human Kidney Organoids Mirrors a Nephrotic Gene Signature in Patient Biopsies'. It contains the term 'Pyroptotic Angiopathy', which is a pathological condition. It also mentions a 'Nephrotic Gene Signature', which is a characteristic rather than a standalone disease.
- The session_title is 'Glomerular Diseases: From Multiomics to Mechanisms'. It contains the clear and clinically established disease category 'Glomerular Diseases'.

Step 2: Select the Source
- According to the Single-Source Extraction Principle, the abstract title should be preferred as it contains a disease term ('Angiopathy').
- However, the term 'Pyroptotic Angiopathy' describes a specific, mechanism-based pathological finding within a preclinical model ('in Human Kidney Organoids'). The title's focus is on mirroring a 'Nephrotic Gene Signature', not on treating patients with this specific type of angiopathy.
- The session title, 'Glomerular Diseases', provides a broader, more clinically relevant context for the research described in the abstract. It represents the overarching therapeutic area and patient population.
- In this case, the session title provides a more clinically valid and standard indication than the specific mechanistic term from the abstract title. Therefore, the session title is selected as the source for the indication.

Step 3: Construct Indication
- The disease term identified in the session title is 'Glomerular Diseases'.
- Applying the generic rule for singular form, 'Glomerular Diseases' is converted to 'Glomerular Disease'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title 'Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in adult cancer patients: Tertiary cancer center experience.' was chosen as it contains specific medical conditions ('COVID-19', 'cancer'), whereas the session title 'Care Delivery and Regulatory Policy' does not.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title identifies two distinct medical conditions ('COVID-19' and 'cancer') within a specific patient population ('adult cancer patients').
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Age Group' category were retrieved to handle the term 'adult'. Rules for 'Patient with two different Disease' were also queried to confirm handling of concurrent conditions.
4.  **Rule Application**:
    *   **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied. The title describes a cohort of patients defined by two conditions (cancer and COVID-19). Both are extracted as separate indications, separated by ';;'.
    *   **Age Group**: The retrieved rule for 'Adult' (ID: 289) specifies prefixing the indication with 'Adult'. This prefix is applied to both identified conditions.
    *   **Formatting**: Generic rules were applied to ensure Title Case ('Cancer') and singular form. 'COVID-19' is maintained in its standard uppercase form.
    *   **Exclusion**: The phrase 'Tertiary cancer center experience' describes the study setting and is correctly excluded from the indication.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The components were combined according to the rules: the 'Adult' prefix was added to both 'COVID-19' and 'Cancer', and the two resulting indications were joined with the ';;' separator.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Gene type', 'Stage', 'Occurrence', and 'Treatment based' to guide the standardization of these components.
4.  **Rule Application & Standardization**:
    *   **Disease Name**: 'Nsclc' was expanded to its full form 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer' and standardized to Title Case along with its subtype, resulting in 'Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer'.
    *   **Gene Mutation**: 'Egfr-Mutant' was standardized to 'EGFR-Mutant', ensuring the gene symbol is in uppercase as per standard convention.
    *   **Stage/Occurrence**: The phrase 'Locally Advanced Or Metastatic' was identified. While Rule 177 suggests consolidating 'advanced' and 'metastatic' into 'Locally Advanced Metastatic', the explicit use of 'or' in a clinical trial title is significant and was retained for precision. The phrase was converted to Title Case: 'Locally Advanced or Metastatic'.
    *   **Progression Status**: The clause 'Who Have Progression Following Egfr-Tki Treatment' clearly defines the disease state. Based on Occurrence Rule 184 ('Progressive'), this was concisely and accurately standardized to the term 'Progressive'.

    *   The retrieved 'Chromosome type' rules were not directly applicable to this specific translocation format, so the standard cytogenetic nomenclature 'T(6;9)(P22;Q34)' was preserved as it is clinically precise.
    *   The connector 'And' in the title links the disease to the translocation. The most clinically accurate representation is to use 'with' to connect the disease and its defining characteristic.
    *   Generic rules were applied: The redundant abbreviation '(Aml)' was removed. The output was formatted to Title Case, with the preposition 'with' in lower case per casing rules. The disease term 'Leukemia' is already in singular form.

Step 2: The components identified in the session title are 'Young', 'Oncologist', and 'Tumor'.
Step 3: Rules for the 'Age Group' category were retrieved for the term 'Young'. The rules indicate that 'Young' as a standalone descriptor should be excluded unless it is part of a specific phrase like 'Young Adult'. In this context, 'Young' describes the oncologist, not the patient, so it falls under the generic exclusion rule for non-patient descriptors.
Step 4: The term 'Oncologist' points to the therapeutic area of Oncology, which can be mapped to 'Cancer' per generic rules. The title also explicitly contains the disease term 'Tumor'. 'Tumor' is more specific and directly mentioned in the context of the 'Molecular Tumor Board'.
Step 5: The term 'Molecular' describes the type of tumor board (a meeting/methodology) and not the tumor itself, so it is excluded as a procedural/methodological qualifier.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title 'Vaso-Occlusive Events in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Quantifying Social Disadvantage and Its Impact on Hospitalizations' was chosen over the session title 'Outcomes Research-Non-Malignant Conditions: Poster I' because it contains a specific disease name ('Sickle Cell Disease'), whereas the session title provides only a broad category.
2.  **Component Identification**: From the abstract title, I identified the core disease 'Sickle Cell Disease' and an age-based patient subgroup 'Pediatric'. The term 'Vaso-Occlusive Events' describes the clinical manifestation being studied within this patient population, rather than being part of the core indication name itself. Terms like 'Social Disadvantage' and 'Hospitalizations' are research outcomes and were excluded.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Sleep Characterization of Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease...') was chosen because it contains a specific disease ('Sickle Cell Disease'), whereas the session title ('Outcomes Research-Non-Malignant Conditions: Poster I') is a broad, non-specific category. This adheres to the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The selected title contains one disease and two distinct patient subgroups based on age: 
    - Disease: 'Sickle Cell Disease'
    - Age Groups: 'Adolescent' and 'Young Adult'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting for the age groups, I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Adolescent', 'Young', and 'Adult' subcategories.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    - The generic rule for singular form was applied, though 'Sickle Cell Disease' is already singular.
    - The generic rule for Title Case was applied.
    - The retrieved rules for 'Adolescent' (Rule 318) and 'Young Adult' (Rule 311) confirm they should be used as prefixes to the disease name.
    - The presence of 'and' connecting two distinct patient subgroups ('Adolescent and Young Adult') implies that the study covers both groups. Following the pattern for handling multiple distinct groups (similar to Rule 314 for 'Children/Adolescent'), the indication is split into two, one for each age group, with the core disease duplicated.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The two indications were constructed separately and then combined:

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Unmanipulated Peripheral Haploidentical Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Is An Effective Consolidative Strategy For High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukaemia And Myelodysplastic Syndrome') contains specific disease names, while the session title ('Stem cell transplantation - Clinical') is generic. Therefore, the abstract title was chosen as the source based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: Two distinct diseases were identified: 'Acute Myeloid Leukaemia' and 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome'. A risk qualifier, 'High-Risk', was also identified. Procedural terms like 'Unmanipulated Peripheral Haploidentical Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant' and 'Consolidative Strategy' were marked for exclusion per generic rules.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Risk' category (specifically 'High-Risk') were retrieved to ensure correct formatting. Rules for handling multiple diseases were also checked, which defaulted to the generic rule for using the ';;' separator.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring both diseases to be extracted and separated by ';;'.
    *   The 'High-Risk' qualifier precedes the coordinated noun phrase 'Acute Myeloid Leukaemia And Myelodysplastic Syndrome'. Grammatically and clinically, this modifier applies to both entities. Therefore, 'High-Risk' was prepended to both disease names.
    *   Procedural terms were excluded as per the generic exclusion rules.
    *   Formatting rules (Title Case, singular form) were applied. 'Leukaemia' and 'Syndrome' are already singular.

3. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: I retrieved specific rules for each identified component using the `get_indication_rules` tool to ensure correct normalization and formatting.
4. **Apply Rules**: 
   - 'Adult' is kept as a leading descriptor based on Age Group rules.
   - 'Relapsed Or Refractory' is normalized to 'Relapsed/Refractory' per Occurrence rules.
   - 'Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative' is abbreviated to 'Ph Chromosome-Negative' as per Chromosome type rules.
   - 'Cd22-Positive' is a biomarker that is retained and formatted in Title Case as 'CD22-Positive'.
   - 'B-Cell Precursor' is a specific patient subgroup and is retained.
   - The core disease 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' is already in singular form and is formatted in Title Case.
   - Generic exclusion rules were applied to remove the treatment name ('Inotuzumab Ozogamicin') and the geographical descriptor ('French').

Rule ID 119 (for Grade 2) and similar rules for other grades confirmed that Arabic numerals should be converted to Roman numerals (2 -> II, 3 -> III) and that multiple grades mentioned together should be split into separate indications.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The phrase 'grade 2 and 3 glioma' was identified as representing two distinct clinical indications.
   - The indications were separated: 'grade 2 glioma' and 'grade 3 glioma'.
   - The generic rule for singular form was applied, but 'glioma' is already singular.
   - The generic rule for Title Case was applied to capitalize 'Glioma'.
   - The retrieved grade-specific rules were applied to convert Arabic numerals to Roman numerals, resulting in 'Grade II' and 'Grade III'.
   - The multiple disease rule was applied to join the two final indications with the ';;' separator.
5. **Indication Construction**: The components were assembled into the final string: 'Grade II Glioma;;Grade III Glioma'.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title 'Minimal Residual Disease Monitoring And Preemptive Immunotherapies For Frequent 11Q23 Rearranged Acute Leukemia After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation' was chosen because it contains a specific disease ('Acute Leukemia'), whereas the session title is a general procedural category.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'Acute Leukemia' and the chromosomal alteration '11Q23 Rearranged'. The phrase 'After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation' was identified as a treatment context.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Chromosome type' to understand how to handle '11Q23 Rearranged' and for 'Treatment Set-up' (specifically 'Transplant Status') to handle the post-transplantation context.
4. **Rule Application**:
   - **Generic Exclusion Rule**: The terms 'Minimal Residual Disease Monitoring' and 'Preemptive Immunotherapies' are procedural/methodological and were excluded.
   - **Treatment Set-up Rule**: The retrieved rules for 'Transplant Status' (e.g., Rule ID 232, 233 for 'Post-Transplant') mandate the exclusion of temporal treatment statuses. 'After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation' falls into this category and was therefore excluded.
   - **Chromosome Type**: While no specific rule dictated the exact formatting for '11Q23 Rearranged', it is a critical clinical descriptor defining a specific subtype of leukemia. It was retained as a qualifier.
   - **Generic Formatting Rule**: The disease term 'Acute Leukemia' is already singular and was converted to Title Case. The qualifier '11Q23 Rearranged' was standardized to '11q23-Rearranged' for clarity and common clinical notation, prepending it to the disease name.
   - The term 'Frequent' was excluded as it describes the incidence of the rearrangement rather than being a standard clinical qualifier for the disease itself.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract_title ('Systemic therapeutic options') contains no disease term, only a treatment modality. The session_title ('Oligometastatic disease and oligoprogression in breast cancer') contains the disease 'breast cancer' and relevant clinical qualifiers. Therefore, the session_title was selected as the source based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The session_title contains one primary disease, 'breast cancer', and two distinct clinical states: 'Oligometastatic' and 'oligoprogression'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To correctly format the clinical state qualifiers, rules were retrieved for 'Metastasis-Related Terms' and 'Progression-Related' from the 'Occurrence' category.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    - The rule for 'Oligometastatic' (ID: 156) instructs to construct the indication as 'Oligometastatic <Disease>'. Applying this to 'breast cancer' yields 'Oligometastatic Breast Cancer'.
    - The term 'oligoprogression' is the noun form of the state described by the 'Oligoprogressive' rule (ID: 157). This rule guides the normalization of the term to the adjectival form 'Oligoprogressive' placed before the disease name. This results in 'Oligoprogressive Breast Cancer'.
    - The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, using ';;' to separate the two distinct indications.
    - Generic formatting rules (Title Case, singular form) were applied to both indications.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('L-Asparaginase Associated Acute Pancreatitis In Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia') was chosen over the session title ('Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Clinical') because it is more specific and contains more detailed information, including multiple conditions and a patient subgroup, adhering to the 'Abstract Title first' principle.

2. **Component Identification**: The abstract title contains two distinct medical conditions: 'Acute Pancreatitis' and 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'. It also identifies a patient subgroup: 'Children'. The phrase 'L-Asparaginase Associated' is identified as a descriptor for Acute Pancreatitis.

3. **Rule Retrieval & Application**:
   - **Age Group**: Rules for 'Childhood' were retrieved using `get_indication_rules(category=""Age Group"", subcategories=[""Childhood""])`. Rule ID 294 directs the replacement of 'Children' with the prefix 'Childhood' before the associated disease name.
   - **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rules for multiple diseases were applied, requiring the extraction of all distinct conditions and separating them with ';;'.
   - **Exclusion Rule**: The descriptor 'L-Asparaginase Associated' indicates that the pancreatitis is a complication or adverse effect of a treatment. According to the generic exclusion rules, 'Complications or adverse effects' should be excluded from the final indication. Therefore, this phrase was removed.

4. **Indication Construction**:
   - The patient subgroup 'Children' is linked to the patients who have Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and the pancreatitis occurs within this group. Therefore, the 'Childhood' qualifier applies to both conditions.
   - 'Acute Pancreatitis' combined with the age qualifier becomes 'Childhood Acute Pancreatitis'.
   - 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' combined with the age qualifier becomes 'Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'.
   - The two indications are combined using the ';;' separator.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Intradialytic Amino Acids Improved Malnutrition Markers in ESRD with Complex Congenital Heart Disease on Peritoneal Dialysis') was chosen over the session title ('Health Maintenance, Nutrition, and Metabolism') because it contains specific disease terms, adhering to the single-source principle.
2. **Component Identification**: Two distinct diseases were identified in the abstract title: 'ESRD' and 'Complex Congenital Heart Disease'. The term 'with' connects them, indicating a patient population with both conditions.
3. **Rule Application (Generic)**:
   - **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring both conditions to be extracted and separated by ';;'.
   - **Standardization**: 'ESRD' was expanded to its full standard name 'End-Stage Renal Disease'.
   - **Exclusion**: The procedural qualifier 'on Peritoneal Dialysis' and the non-diagnostic term 'Malnutrition Markers' were excluded as per generic exclusion rules.
   - **Formatting**: Both indications were converted to Title Case and singular form.

   - A rule check for 'Patient with two different Disease' was performed, but no specific rules were found, defaulting to the generic separator rule.
   - A rule check for 'Disease Characterisation' was done for the term 'Complex'. No specific rule exists, so the clinically significant descriptor 'Complex' was retained.
   - A rule check for 'Genetic Origin' was done for 'Congenital'. No specific rule exists, so this standard medical term, being part of the disease name, was retained.

1.  **Analyze Input Titles**: The `abstract_title` is 'MicroRNA 185-5p is a novel biomarker associated with high-risk pathology at radical prostatectomy in patients with low-risk disease at diagnosis'. The `session_title` is 'MP45: Prostate Cancer: Markers'.
2.  **Select Source**: According to the Single-Source Extraction Principle, the abstract title is preferred if it contains a disease term. The abstract title contains patient subgroup information ('low-risk', 'high-risk') but only the generic term 'disease', which is not a specific, clinically valid indication. The session title, however, provides the clear and specific disease 'Prostate Cancer'. To generate a clinically valid indication, the abstract title is discarded for its lack of a specific disease, and the session title is used as the source.
3.  **Identify Components**: From the selected `session_title` ('MP45: Prostate Cancer: Markers'), the core disease component is 'Prostate Cancer'. The terms 'MP45' and 'Markers' are session identifiers and topics, not part of the medical indication, and are therefore excluded.
4.  **Retrieve Rules**: No specific category rules were needed for this straightforward extraction.

4. **Rule Application and Component Normalization**:
   - **Disease**: 'Renal Cell Cancer' was kept as the core disease, and the abbreviation '(Rcc)' was removed. The term is already in singular form.
   - **Risk Qualifier**: Based on the pattern from retrieved 'Risk Types' rules, 'Very High-Risk' was identified as a critical patient subgroup qualifier and was prepended to the disease name. It was formatted in Title Case.
   - **Histology/Subtype**: 'Clear Cell' is a crucial histological subtype of Renal Cell Cancer. The term 'Histology' was dropped as it is descriptive of the analysis type, not the disease itself. 'Clear Cell' was included in the indication.
   - **Exclusions**: Following generic exclusion rules and the patterns in the retrieved 'Treatment Set-up' rules (e.g., for 'Post Operative'), the terms 'Adjuvant' (treatment timing) and 'Completely Resected' (procedural status) were excluded as they describe the treatment context rather than defining the core indication.

5. **Indication Construction**: The identified and normalized components were assembled in the standard clinical order: [Risk] [Histology/Subtype] [Disease]. This resulted in 'Very High-Risk Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer'.

The retrieved rules (e.g., ID 295, 296) confirm that age-group qualifiers like 'Pediatric' should be prepended to the indication.
4.  **Rule Application and Normalization**:
    *   The patient subgroup 'Children' is normalized to the standard medical term 'Pediatric'.
    *   The procedural term 'Bone Marrow Aspiration' is excluded as per the generic exclusion rules.
    *   The disease term 'Anemia Of Unknown Etiology' is retained.

The treatment information ('Rituximab, Bendamustine and Cytarabine Followed By Venetoclax (V-RBAC)') and the term 'Patients' were identified for exclusion.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting and standardization, rules were retrieved for the identified patient subgroups. Specifically, `get_indication_rules` was called for the 'Risk' category (subcategory 'High-Risk') and the 'Age Group' category (subcategory 'Elderly').
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The generic rule for singular form was applied, though 'Mantle Cell Lymphoma' is already singular.
   - The generic rule for Title Case was applied to all components.
   - The retrieved 'Age Group' rules (e.g., ID 299) confirmed that 'Elderly' should be standardized and placed at the beginning of the indication.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title was chosen as it contains specific disease and patient subgroup information ('Anemia Due To Lower-Risk Mds', 'Esa-Naive Patients Requiring Rbc Transfusions'), which is more detailed than the session title ('Myelodysplastic Syndromes - Clinical').

2.  **Component Identification**: I identified the following key components from the abstract title:
    *   Core Condition: 'Anemia'
    *   Underlying Disease: 'Lower-Risk Mds'
    *   Patient Treatment Status: 'Esa-Naive'
    *   Patient Subgroup: 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions'

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I mentally reviewed the rules for handling risk, treatment status, and multiple conditions.
    *   **Risk**: The term 'Lower-Risk' needs to be standardized in Title Case with a hyphen.
    *   **Treatment Status**: 'Esa-Naive' is a critical descriptor of treatment history and should be placed at the beginning of the indication. 'ESA' is an acronym and should be capitalized.
    *   **Disease Normalization**: 'Mds' is a standard abbreviation for Myelodysplastic Syndromes. It should be expanded and converted to singular Title Case: 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome'.
    *   **Patient Subgroup**: 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions' is a key clinical characteristic defining the patient population and must be included.

4.  **Indication Construction**: I assembled the components based on clinical and grammatical conventions:
    *   The primary condition being treated is 'Anemia'. The cause is 'Lower-Risk Mds'. The title explicitly links them with 'Due To'.
    *   The patient population is defined by being 'Esa-Naive' and 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions'.
    *   I started with the treatment status 'ESA-Naive' as it's a primary qualifier.
    *   I then constructed the core indication 'Anemia due to Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome'.
    *   Finally, I appended the patient characteristic 'Requiring RBC Transfusions' to complete the description.

5.  **Final Formatting**: I applied the generic formatting rules:
    *   **Title Case**: Capitalized all significant words (e.g., 'Anemia', 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome'). Short prepositions like 'due to' are in lower case.
    *   **Acronyms**: Kept 'ESA' and 'RBC' in their original all-caps form.
    *   **Singular Form**: Used 'Syndrome' instead of 'Syndromes'.
    *   **Spacing**: Ensured single spaces between all words.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title is 'Interactive Panel Discussion: Challenging Cases Involving Infections Associated with CLL' and the session title is 'Interactive Session: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Beyond - Management of the Infection Burden'.
2. **Select Source**: Both titles contain disease terms. According to the single-source principle, the abstract title is the preferred source. It contains 'Infections' and 'CLL'.
3. **Identify Components**: The abstract title identifies two distinct clinical conditions: 'Infections' and 'CLL'. The phrase 'Associated with' links them, indicating co-occurrence.
4. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient with two different Disease' to understand how to handle co-occurring conditions and 'Occurrence' for connector words. The retrieved rules did not specifically cover 'Associated with', so I fell back to the generic rule for multiple diseases.
5. **Apply Rules**:
   - **Generic Rule (Multiple Diseases)**: The title mentions two distinct conditions, 'Infections' and 'CLL'. They must be extracted as separate indications, delimited by ';;'.
   - **Generic Rule (Singular Form)**: The plural 'Infections' is converted to its singular form, 'Infection'.
   - **Generic Rule (Casing)**: All terms are converted to Title Case.
   - **Standardization**: The abbreviation 'CLL' is expanded to its full name, 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', for clinical clarity. This is supported by the context from the session title.
6. **Construct Indication**: The identified and normalized components are combined using the ';;' separator, resulting in 'Infection;;Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'.

1.  **Source Selection**: Both the abstract and session titles mention 'Prostate Cancer'. The abstract title is more specific, containing details about gene mutations, risk, and patient subgroups, so it was chosen as the source based on the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title were 'ATM mutations' (gene mutation), 'high-risk' (risk stratification), 'familial' (patient subgroup), and 'prostate cancer' (disease). The term 'men' was identified as a sociodemographic descriptor to be excluded.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Gene type' to handle 'ATM mutations', 'Risk' for 'high-risk', and 'Patient Sub-Group' for 'familial'.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Exclusion Rule**: The gender descriptor 'men' was removed.
    *   **Gene Type Rule**: 'ATM mutations' was normalized to 'ATM-Mutated' based on the retrieved rule for gene mutations.
    *   **Risk Rule**: 'high-risk' was normalized to 'High-Risk'.
    *   **Patient Subgroup Rule**: 'familial' was normalized to 'Familial' and identified as a primary qualifier.
    *   **Formatting Rules**: The final indication was converted to Title Case and singular form.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The normalized components were combined in a clinically logical order: Patient Subgroup -> Gene Mutation -> Risk -> Disease. This resulted in 'Familial ATM-Mutated High-Risk Prostate Cancer'. The phrasing of the title suggests these are all characteristics of the patient population being studied.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title 'Venous Thromboembolism (Vte) In Patients With Advanced High Grade Ovarian Carcinoma (Ahgoc) Receiving Parp Inhibitors' was chosen over the session title 'Supportive Care' because it contains specific disease terms, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title identifies two distinct medical conditions: 'Venous Thromboembolism' and 'Advanced High Grade Ovarian Carcinoma'. The phrase 'In Patients With' indicates these are comorbidities.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient with two different Disease', 'Stage', 'Grade', and 'Treatment Set-up'.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring both conditions to be extracted and separated by ';;'.
    *   **Grade**: The specific rule for 'High Grade' (ID: 115) confirmed it should be normalized to 'High Grade' and placed before the disease name.
    *   **Stage**: 'Advanced' was kept as a standard clinical qualifier for the carcinoma.
    *   **Exclusion**: The phrase 'Receiving Parp Inhibitors' was excluded as it describes a procedural/temporal treatment context, which is a standard exclusion criterion.
    *   **Formatting**: Abbreviations (Vte, Ahgoc) were removed, and the final output was formatted to Title Case and singular form as required.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The first indication was normalized to 'Venous Thromboembolism'.
