  "reasoning": "Step-by-step extraction process:\n1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title contains specific disease information ('metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer'), so it was chosen as the sole source, and the session title was ignored, following the Single-Source Extraction Principle.\n2. **Component Identification**: I identified the core disease 'prostate cancer' and its associated clinical qualifiers 'metastatic' and 'castration-resistant'.\n3. **Rule Application**: I applied the generic rules. The components were converted to Title Case. The disease term is already in singular form. Non-indication elements such as trial names ('EORTC 1333/PEACE-3'), drug names ('Enzalutamide', 'radium-223'), and study endpoints ('Final overall survival results') were excluded.\n4. **Indication Construction**: The identified components were combined in their clinical order to form the final indication: 'Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer'.",
