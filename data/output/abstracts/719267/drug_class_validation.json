Hallucination Check: The phrase 'androgen receptor inhibitor' appears exactly in all three FDA label search results. No hallucination.\n3. Omission Check: The abstract title mentions 'radium-223' but only as a co-treatment, not as a class for the primary drug (Rule 30). The abstract text was not provided. Search results do not mention 'Hormonal Therapy' or other classes for Enzalutamide specifically.\n4. Rule Compliance: The extraction follows Title Case (Rule 3) and correctly identifies the MoA including the target (Rule 11). No formatting or transformation rules were violated.\n5. Conclusion: All checks passed. The extraction is accurate based on the provided sources and rules.",
