  "reasoning": "Step 1: The abstract title contains a specific disease, 'metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer', so it was chosen as the sole source based on the single-source principle.\nStep 2: I identified the core components in the title: the disease ('prostate cancer'), metastasis status ('metastatic'), treatment resistance ('castration-resistant'), line of treatment ('first-line'), and a genetic characteristic ('with DNA repair defects').\nStep 3: I attempted to retrieve specific rules for 'Occurrence', 'Treatment Set-up', and 'Patient Sub-Group' to ensure correct formatting, but the tool calls failed. Therefore, I proceeded using the generic rules.\nStep 4: I applied the generic rules. The disease was converted to Title Case and singular form ('Prostate Cancer'). The qualifiers 'metastatic', 'castration-resistant', and 'first-line' were also converted to Title Case and prepended to the disease name as they are standard clinical descriptors. The genetic characteristic 'with DNA repair defects' was retained as it describes a key patient subgroup and formatted in Title Case.\nStep 5: The final indication was constructed by combining these components, resulting in a clinically precise description of the patient population.",
