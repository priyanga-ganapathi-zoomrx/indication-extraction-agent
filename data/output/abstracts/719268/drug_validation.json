Analyzed the title context: 'abiraterone, olaparib, or abiraterone + olaparib'. This indicates a three-arm study where each agent is a primary object of evaluation.\n3. Per Rule 1, keywords 'or' and '+' designate both agents as Primary drugs.\n4. Although they are being compared against each other, in a phase 2 multi-arm trial where all are experimental interventions, classifying both as Primary is the most accurate representation of the therapeutic intent.\n5. No hallucinations or omissions were detected; BRCAAway is a trial name and correctly ignored. All formatting rules were followed.",
