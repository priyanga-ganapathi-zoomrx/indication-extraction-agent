Rule Compliance: The extractor correctly applied Rule 11 (Biological target PARP) and Rule 13 (Inhibitor term) to normalize the class to 'PARP Inhibitor'. Rule 3 (Title Case) and Rule 5 (Singular form) were also followed.\n4. Omission Check: Search results mentioned 'antineoplastic agent' and 'apoptosis inducer'.
