Do not eat food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking ZYTIGA. The tablets must be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets.\n\n  ## 2.4 Dose Modification Guidelines in Hepatic Impairment and Hepatotoxicity\n\n  Hepatic Impairment\n\n  In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of ZYTIGA to 250 mg once daily. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue ZYTIGA and do not re-treat patients with ZYTIGA [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.6)](#S8.6)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n\n  Do not use ZYTIGA in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\n  Hepatotoxicity\n\n  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with ZYTIGA (ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN), interrupt treatment with ZYTIGA [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)]. Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN .For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter.\n\n  If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN .\n\n  If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with ZYTIGA.\n\n  Permanently discontinue ZYTIGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)] .\n\n  ## 2.5 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers\n\n  Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during ZYTIGA treatment.\n\n  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the ZYTIGA dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued [see [Drug Interactions (7.1)](#S7.1)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n* [3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS](#)\n\n  Tablets (500 mg): purple, oval-shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with \"AA\" one side and \"500\" on the other side.\n\n  Tablets (250 mg): white to off-white, oval-shaped tablets debossed with \"AA250\" on one side.\n* [4 CONTRAINDICATIONS](#)\n\n  None.\n* [5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS](#)\n\n  ## 5.1 Hypokalemia, Fluid Retention, and Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions due to Mineralocorticoid Excess\n\n  ZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)](#S12.1)] . Monitor patients for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with ZYTIGA.\n\n  In the combined data from 4 placebo-controlled trials using prednisone 5 mg twice daily in combination with 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate daily, grades 3–4 hypokalemia were detected in 4% of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 2% of patients on the placebo arm. Grades 3–4 hypertension were observed in 2% of patients each arm and grades 3–4 fluid retention in 1% of patients each arm.\n\n  In LATITUDE (a randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial), which used prednisone 5 mg daily in combination with 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate daily, grades 3–4 hypokalemia were detected in 10% of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 1% of patients on the placebo arm, grades 3–4 hypertension were observed in 20% of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 10% of patients on the placebo arm. Grades 3–4 fluid retention occurred in 1% of patients each arm [see [Adverse Reactions (6)](#S6)] .\n\n  Closely monitor patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, hypokalemia or fluid retention, such as those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, or ventricular arrhythmia. In postmarketing experience, QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes have been observed in patients who develop hypokalemia while taking ZYTIGA.\n\n  The safety of ZYTIGA in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (in COU-AA-301) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure (in COU-AA-302 and LATITUDE) has not been established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#S14)] .\n\n  ## 5.2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency\n\n  Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.3% of 2230 patients taking ZYTIGA and in 0.1% of 1763 patients taking placebo in the combined data of the 5 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress.\n\n  Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone, have prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with ZYTIGA. If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)].\n\n  ## 5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n  In postmarketing experience, there have been ZYTIGA-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see [Adverse Reactions (6.2)](#S6.2)] .\n\n  In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 × ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received ZYTIGA, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking ZYTIGA. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to ZYTIGA were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.\n\n  Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ZYTIGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ZYTIGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ZYTIGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.\n\n  Re-treatment with ZYTIGA at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#S2.4)] .\n\n  Permanently discontinue ZYTIGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#S2.4)] .\n\n  The safety of ZYTIGA re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 × ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 × ULN is unknown.\n\n  ## 5.4 Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Radium Ra 223 Dichloride\n\n  ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone is not recommended for use in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride outside of clinical trials.\n\n  The clinical efficacy and safety of concurrent initiation of ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone and radium Ra 223 dichloride was assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study (ERA-223 trial) in 806 patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases. The study was unblinded early based on an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation.\n\n  At the primary analysis, increased incidences of fractures (28.6% vs 11.4%) and deaths (38.5% vs 35.5%) have been observed in patients who received ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride compared to patients who received placebo in combination with ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone.\n\n  ## 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n  The safety and efficacy of ZYTIGA have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, ZYTIGA can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZYTIGA and for 3 weeks after the last dose of ZYTIGA [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1](#S8.1), [8.3)](#S8.3)] . ZYTIGA should not be handled by females who are or may become pregnant [see [How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)](#S16)].\n\n  ## 5.6 Hypoglycemia\n\n  Severe hypoglycemia has been reported when ZYTIGA was administered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving medications containing thiazolidinediones (including pioglitazone) or repaglinide [see [Drug Interactions (7.2)](#S7.2)] . Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes during and after discontinuation of treatment with ZYTIGA. Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.\n* [6 ADVERSE REACTIONS](#)\n\n  The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n  + Hypokalemia, Fluid Retention, and Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions due to Mineralocorticoid Excess [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)] .\n  + Adrenocortical Insufficiency [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](#S5.2)] .\n  + Hepatotoxicity [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)] .\n  + Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Radium Ra 223 Dichloride [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.4)](#S5.4)].\n\n  ## 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience\n\n  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n\n  Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302) enrolled patients who had metastatic CRPC in which ZYTIGA was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. A third randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (LATITUDE) enrolled patients who had metastatic high-risk CSPC in which ZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg once daily. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2230 patients in the 5 randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1–4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1–4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms.\n\n  In the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for ZYTIGA-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occurred more commonly (>2%) in the ZYTIGA arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the ZYTIGA arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3–4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patients in the ZYTIGA arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the ZYTIGA arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of ZYTIGA and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders.\n\n  Deaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the ZYTIGA arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the ZYTIGA arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in ≥5 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration.\n\n  COU-AA-301: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy\n\n  COU-AA-301 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT ≥2.5 × ULN in the absence of liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases were excluded if AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN.\n\n  Table 1 shows adverse reactions on the ZYTIGA arm in COU-AA-301 that occurred with a ≥2% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo or were events of special interest.

Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% of patients taking ZYTIGA and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 4 deaths. Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.\n\n  In the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the ZYTIGA arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the ZYTIGA arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the ZYTIGA arms.\n\n  ## 6.2 Postmarketing Experience\n\n  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ZYTIGA with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\n  Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:non-infectious pneumonitis.\n\n  Musculoskeletaland Connective Tissue Disorders:myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.\n\n  Hepatobiliary Disorders:fulminant hepatitis, including acute hepatic failure and death.\n\n  Cardiac Disorders:QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (observed in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions).\n\n  Immune System Disorders – Hypersensitivity:anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions that include, but are not limited to difficulty swallowing or breathing, swollen face, lips, tongue or throat, or an itchy rash (urticaria)).\n* [7 DRUG INTERACTIONS](#)\n\n  ## 7.1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes\n\n  Based on in vitrodata, ZYTIGA is a substrate of CYP3A4.\n\n  In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during ZYTIGA treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the ZYTIGA dosing frequency [see [Dosage and Administration (2.5)](#S2.5)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n\n  In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n\n  ## 7.2 Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes\n\n  ZYTIGA is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the C maxand AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n\n  In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with ZYTIGA [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)and [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)](#S5.6)] .\n* [8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS](#)\n\n  ## 8.1 Pregnancy\n\n  Risk Summary\n\n  The safety and efficacy of ZYTIGA have not been established in females. Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, ZYTIGA can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy.\n\n  There are no human data on the use of ZYTIGA in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose (see [Data](#Data)).\n\n  Data\n\n  Animal Data\n\n  In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6–17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses), fetal developmental delay (skeletal effects) and urogenital effects (bilateral ureter dilation) at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal ano-genital distance at ≥30 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg/kg/day. Doses ≥10 mg/kg/day caused maternal toxicity. The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the AUC in patients.\n\n  ## 8.2 Lactation\n\n  Risk Summary\n\n  The safety and efficacy of ZYTIGA have not been established in females. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production.\n\n  ## 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\n  Contraception\n\n  Males\n\n  Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the final dose of ZYTIGA [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#S8.1)] .\n\n  Infertility\n\n  Based on animal studies, ZYTIGA may impair reproductive function and fertility in males of reproductive potential [see [Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)](#S13.1)].\n\n  ## 8.4 Pediatric Use\n\n  Safety and effectiveness of ZYTIGA in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n  ## 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\n  Of the total number of patients receiving ZYTIGA in randomized clinical trials, 70% of patients were 65 years and over and 27% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n  ## 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n\n  The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose of ZYTIGA increased by approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n\n  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold and the fraction of free drug increased 2-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n\n  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild hepatic impairment. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of ZYTIGA to 250 mg once daily. Do not use ZYTIGA in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). If elevations in ALT or AST >5 × ULN or total bilirubin >3 × ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue ZYTIGA treatment [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#S2.4)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n\n  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, interruption of treatment and dosage adjustment may be required [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#S2.4), [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3), and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)].\n\n  ## 8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)] .\n* [10 OVERDOSAGE](#)\n\n  Human experience of overdose with ZYTIGA is limited.\n\n  There is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, stop ZYTIGA, undertake general supportive measures, including monitoring for arrhythmias and cardiac failure and assess liver function.\n* [11 DESCRIPTION](#)\n\n  Abiraterone acetate, the active ingredient of ZYTIGA ® is the acetyl ester of abiraterone. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase). Each ZYTIGA tablet contains either 250 mg or 500 mg of abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate is designated chemically as (3β)-17-(3-pyridinyl) androsta-5,16-dien-3-yl acetate and its structure is:\n\n  Abiraterone acetate is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. Its molecular formula is C 26H 33NO 2 and it has a molecular weight of 391.55. Abiraterone acetate is a lipophilic compound with an octanol-water partition coefficient of 5.12 (Log P) and is practically insoluble in water. The pKa of the aromatic nitrogen is 5.19.\n\n  ZYTIGA tablets are available in 500 mg film-coated tablets and 250 mg uncoated tablets with the following inactive ingredients:\n\n  + 500 mg film-coated tablets: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate. The coating, Opadry ®II Purple, contains iron oxide black, iron oxide red, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide.\n  + 250 mg uncoated tablets: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and sodium lauryl sulfate.\n* [12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](#)\n\n  ## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\n  Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis.\n\n  CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by 17α-hydroxylase activity and 2) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#S5.1)] .\n\n  Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.\n\n  ZYTIGA decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of ZYTIGA on serum testosterone levels.\n\n  Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.\n\n  ## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\n  Cardiac Electrophysiology\n\n  In a multi-center, open-label, single-arm trial, 33 patients with metastatic CRPC received ZYTIGA orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) from baseline. However, small increases in the QTc interval (i.e., <10 ms) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be excluded due to study design limitations.\n\n  ## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n  Following administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone have been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with metastatic CRPC. In vivo, abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels (<0.2 ng/mL) in >99% of the analyzed samples.\n\n  Absorption\n\n  Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate to patients with metastatic CRPC, the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations is 2 hours. Abiraterone accumulation is observed at steady-state, with a 2-fold higher exposure (steady-state AUC) compared to a single 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate.\n\n  At the dose of 1,000 mg daily in patients with metastatic CRPC, steady-state values (mean ± SD) of C max were 226 ± 178 ng/mL and of AUC were 993 ± 639 ng.hr/mL. No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 mg to 1,000 mg. However, the exposure was not significantly increased when the dose was doubled from 1,000 to 2,000 mg (8% increase in the mean AUC).\n\n  Effect of Food\n\n  Systemic exposure of abiraterone is increased when abiraterone acetate is administered with food. In healthy subjects abiraterone C max and AUC 0–∞ were approximately 7- and 5-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a low-fat meal (7% fat, 300 calories) and approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a high-fat (57% fat, 825 calories) meal compared to overnight fasting. Abiraterone AUC 0–∞ was approximately 7-fold or 1.6-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered 2 hours after or 1 hour before a medium fat meal (25% fat, 491 calories) compared to overnight fasting.\n\n  Systemic exposures of abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC, after repeated dosing of abiraterone acetate were similar when abiraterone acetate was taken with low-fat meals for 7 days and increased approximately 2-fold when taken with high-fat meals for 7 days compared to when taken at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 1 hour before a meal for 7 days.\n\n  Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals, taking ZYTIGA with meals has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures.\n\n  Distribution\n\n  Abiraterone is highly bound (>99%) to the human plasma proteins, albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (mean ± SD) is 19,669 ± 13,358 L.\n\n  Elimination\n\n  In patients with metastatic CRPC, the mean terminal half-life of abiraterone in plasma (mean ± SD) is 12 ± 5 hours.\n\n  Metabolism\n\n  Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone (active metabolite). The conversion is likely through esterase activity (the esterases have not been identified) and is not CYP mediated. The two main circulating metabolites of abiraterone in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate (inactive) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (inactive), which account for about 43% of exposure each. CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N-oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate.\n\n  Excretion\n\n  Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose is recovered in feces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present in feces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the administered dose, respectively).\n\n  Specific Populations\n\n  Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n\n  The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone was examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose given under fasting conditions increased approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\n  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the mean protein binding was found to be lower in the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group, which resulted in a two-fold increase in the fraction of free drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment .\n\n  Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n  The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on a stable hemodialysis schedule (N=8) and in matched control subjects with normal renal function (N=8). In the ESRD cohort of the trial, a single 1,000 mg ZYTIGA dose was given under fasting conditions 1 hour after dialysis, and samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 96 hours post dose. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, compared to subjects with normal renal function .\n\n  Drug Interaction Studies\n\n  Clinical Studies\n\n  Effect of Other Drugs on ZYTIGA\n\n  Strong CYP3A4 inducers: In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin, 600 mg daily for 6 days) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma AUC ∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.\n\n  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.\n\n  Effect of ZYTIGA on Other Drugs\n\n  CYP2D6 substrates: The C max and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively when dextromethorphan 30 mg was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily). The AUC for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of dextromethorphan, increased approximately 1.3 fold.\n\n  CYP1A2 substrates: When abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily) was given with a single dose of 100 mg theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), no increase in systemic exposure of theophylline was observed.\n\n  CYP2C8 substrates: The AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given to healthy subjects with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate.\n\n  In Vitro Studies\n\n  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.\n\n  Transporter Systems: In vitro studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations, abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and that abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of P-gp. In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction.\n* [13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY](#)\n\n  ## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\n\n  A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral abiraterone acetate doses of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day for males and 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day for females. Abiraterone acetate increased the combined incidence of interstitial cell adenomas and carcinomas in the testes at all dose levels tested. This finding is considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of abiraterone. Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats at exposure levels up to 0.8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse.\n\n  Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was not mutagenic in an in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes or an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.\n\n  In repeat-dose toxicity studies in male rats (13- and 26-weeks) and monkeys (39-weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, and hyperplasia in the reproductive system were observed at ≥50 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥250 mg/kg/day in monkeys and were consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone. These effects were observed in rats at systemic exposures similar to humans and in monkeys at exposures approximately 0.6 times the AUC in humans.\n\n  In a fertility study in male rats, reduced organ weights of the reproductive system, sperm counts, sperm motility, altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility were observed in animals dosed for 4 weeks at ≥30 mg/kg/day orally. Mating of untreated females with males that received 30 mg/kg/day oral abiraterone acetate resulted in a reduced number of corpora lutea, implantations and live embryos and an increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. Effects on male rats were reversible after 16 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration.\n\n  In a fertility study in female rats, animals dosed orally for 2 weeks until day 7 of pregnancy at ≥30 mg/kg/day had an increased incidence of irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre-implantation loss (300 mg/kg/day). There were no differences in mating, fertility, and litter parameters in female rats that received abiraterone acetate. Effects on female rats were reversible after 4 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration.\n\n  The dose of 30 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day based on body surface area.\n\n  In 13- and 26-week studies in rats and 13- and 39-week studies in monkeys, a reduction in circulating testosterone levels occurred with abiraterone acetate at approximately one half the human clinical exposure based on AUC. As a result, decreases in organ weights and toxicities were observed in the male and female reproductive system, adrenal glands, liver, pituitary (rats only), and male mammary glands. The changes in the reproductive organs are consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone acetate.\n\n  ## 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n\n  A dose-dependent increase in cataracts was observed in rats after daily oral abiraterone acetate administration for 26 weeks starting at ≥50 mg/kg/day (similar to the human clinical exposure based on AUC). In a 39-week monkey study with daily oral abiraterone acetate administration, no cataracts were observed at higher doses (2 times greater than the clinical exposure based on AUC).\n* [14 CLINICAL STUDIES](#)\n\n  The efficacy and safety of ZYTIGA with prednisone was established in three randomized placebo-controlled international clinical studies. All patients in these studies received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer and a history of adrenal gland or pituitary disorders were excluded from these trials. Concurrent use of spironolactone was not allowed during the study period.\n\n  COU-AA-301: Patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy\n\n  In COU-AA-301 (NCT00638690), a total of 1195 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ZYTIGA orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=797) or placebo once daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=398). Patients randomized to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression (defined as a 25% increase in PSA over the patient's baseline/nadir together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and symptomatic or clinical progression), initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal.\n\n  The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 39–95) and the racial distribution was 93% Caucasian, 3.6% Black, 1.7% Asian, and 1.6% Other. Eighty-nine percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0–1 and 45% had a Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form score of ≥4 (patient's reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours). Ninety percent of patients had metastases in bone and 30% had visceral involvement. Seventy percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 30% had PSA-only progression. Seventy percent of patients had previously received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and 30% received two regimens.\n\n  The protocol pre-specified interim analysis was conducted after 552 deaths and showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ZYTIGA with prednisone compared to patients in the placebo with prednisone arm (Table 7 and Figure 1). An updated survival analysis was conducted when 775 deaths (97% of the planned number of deaths for final analysis) were observed. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (Table 7).\n\n  Table 7: Overall Survival of Patients Treated with Either ZYTIGA or Placebo in Combination with Prednisone in COU-AA-301 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)\n\n     | ZYTIGA with Prednisone   (N=797) | Placebo with Prednisone   (N=398) |\n  | [\\*](#footnote-reference-17)  p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0–1 vs. 2), pain score (absent vs. present), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. 2), and type of disease progression (PSA only vs. radiographic).

Both arms were given concomitant prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical (cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to 3 or more) disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Patients with moderate or severe pain, opiate use for cancer pain, or visceral organ metastases were excluded.\n\n  Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 70 years. The racial distribution of patients treated with ZYTIGA was 95% Caucasian, 2.8% Black, 0.7% Asian and 1.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of patients. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Baseline pain assessment was 0–1 (asymptomatic) in 66% of patients and 2–3 (mildly symptomatic) in 26% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours).\n\n  Radiographic progression-free survival was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria) and/or modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. Analysis of rPFS utilized centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.\n\n  The planned final analysis for OS, conducted after 741 deaths (median follow up of 49 months) demonstrated a statistically significant OS improvement in patients treated with ZYTIGA with prednisone compared to those treated with placebo with prednisone (Table 8 and Figure 2). Sixty-five percent of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 78% of patients on the placebo arm used subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. ZYTIGA was used as a subsequent therapy in 13% of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 44% of patients on the placebo arm.\n\n  Table 8: Overall Survival of Patients Treated with Either ZYTIGA or Placebo in Combination with Prednisone in COU-AA-302 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)\n\n     | ZYTIGA with Prednisone   (N=546) | Placebo with Prednisone   (N=542) |\n  | [\\*](#footnote-reference-19)  p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0 vs. 1).

The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 25.2 months for patients in the ZYTIGA arm and 16.8 months for patients in the placebo arm (HR=0.580; 95% CI: [0.487, 0.691], p < 0.0001).\n\n  The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain was not reached for patients receiving ZYTIGA and was 23.7 months for patients receiving placebo (HR=0.686; 95% CI: [0.566, 0.833], p=0.0001). The time to opiate use result was supported by a delay in patient reported pain progression favoring the ZYTIGA arm.\n\n  LATITUDE: Patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC\n\n  In LATITUDE (NCT01715285), 1199 patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC were randomized 1:1 to receive either ZYTIGA orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg once daily (N=597) or placebos orally once daily (N=602). High-risk disease was defined as having at least two of three risk factors at baseline: a total Gleason score of ≥8, presence of ≥3 lesions on bone scan, and evidence of measurable visceral metastases. Patients with significant cardiac, adrenal, or hepatic dysfunction were excluded. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or death. Clinical progression was defined as the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to ≥3.\n\n  Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years among all randomized subjects. The racial distribution of patients treated with ZYTIGA was 69% Caucasian, 2.5% Black, 21% Asian, and 8.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 55%, 1 for 42%, and 2 for 3.5% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0–1 (asymptomatic) in 50% of patients, 2–3 (mildly symptomatic) in 23% of patients, and ≥4 in 28% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours).\n\n  A major efficacy outcome was overall survival. The pre-specified interim analysis after 406 deaths showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients on ZYTIGA with prednisone compared to those on placebos. Twenty-one percent of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 41% of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 618 deaths were observed. The median follow-up time was 52 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre-specified interim analysis (Table 10 and Figure 4). At the updated analysis, 29% of patients on the ZYTIGA arm and 45% of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC.\n\n  Table 10: Overall Survival of Patients Treated with Either ZYTIGA or Placebos in LATITUDE (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)\n\n     | ZYTIGA with Prednisone   (N=597) | Placebos   (N=602) |\n  | NE=Not estimable |\n  | [\\*](#footnote-reference-23)  This is based on the pre-specified interim analysis  [†](#footnote-reference-24)  p value is from log-rank test stratified by ECOG PS score (0/1 or 2) and visceral (absent or present).

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis.

In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the C max and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .",

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3 x ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets and do not re-treat patients with abiraterone acetate tablets [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.6)](#LINK_ab1adba0-d83c-46c9-b297-583145c139b2)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  Do not use abiraterone acetate tablets in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\n  Hepatotoxicity   \n   For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets (ALT and/or AST greater than 5 x ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 x ULN), interrupt treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#LINK_47803f60-6820-4cc4-8471-3ab60a660306)] . Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN. For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter.\n\n  If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.\n\n  If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets. Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#LINK_47803f60-6820-4cc4-8471-3ab60a660306)] .\n\n  ## 2.5 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers\n\n  Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during abiraterone acetate tablets treatment.\n\n  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate tablets dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued [see [Drug Interactions (7.1)](#LINK_24fedb85-a599-4ba3-8d7a-ddcb7c68c821)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n* [3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS](#)\n\n  Abiraterone acetate tablets USP, 250 mg are white to off-white, oval-shaped, uncoated tablets debossed with “AN65” on one side and plain on the other side.\n\n  Abiraterone acetate tablets USP, 500 mg are purple, oval-shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with “1754” on one side and plain on the other side.\n* [4 CONTRAINDICATIONS](#)\n* [5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS](#)\n\n  ## 5.1 Hypokalemia, Fluid Retention, and Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions due to Mineralocorticoid Excess\n\n  Abiraterone acetate may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)](#LINK_fdd7f52d-d8fe-48e2-acf7-f1f0208b3185)] . Monitor patients for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with abiraterone acetate.\n\n  In the combined data from 4 placebo-controlled trials using prednisone 5 mg twice daily in combination with 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate daily, grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia were detected in 4% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 2% of patients on the placebo arm. Grades 3 to 4 hypertension were observed in 2% of patients each arm and grades 3 to 4 fluid retention in 1% of patients each arm.\n\n  In LATITUDE (a randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial), which used prednisone 5 mg daily in combination with 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate daily, grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia were detected in 10% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 1% of patients on the placebo arm, grades 3 to 4 hypertension were observed in 20% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 10% of patients on the placebo arm. Grades 3 to 4 fluid retention occurred in 1% of patients each arm [see [Adverse Reactions (6)](#LINK_e260aaff-3009-4796-9773-a17fe650ea01)] .\n\n  Closely monitor patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, hypokalemia or fluid retention, such as those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, or ventricular arrhythmia. In postmarketing experience, QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes have been observed in patients who develop hypokalemia while taking abiraterone acetate.\n\n  The safety of abiraterone acetate in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (in COU-AA-301) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure (in COU-AA-302 and LATITUDE) has not been established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#LINK_d0076139-84a0-4e68-8fa0-5638f83f80ca)] .\n\n  ## 5.2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency\n\n  Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.3% of 2,230 patients taking abiraterone acetate and in 0.1% of 1,763 patients taking placebo in the combined data of the 5 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress.\n\n  Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone, have prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with abiraterone acetate. If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#LINK_288a8a57-cea5-4971-9f5e-6c3356b0d817)] .\n\n  ## 5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n  In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see [Adverse Reactions (6.2)](#LINK_b4384767-f305-454f-8d79-8862dc265c35)] .\n\n  In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 x ULN) were reported in 6% of 2,230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2,230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.\n\n  Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient’s baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.\n\n  Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient’s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#LINK_bc6a98e6-6e1d-416f-9b1c-d2c767f0ccae)] .\n\n  Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#LINK_bc6a98e6-6e1d-416f-9b1c-d2c767f0ccae)] .\n\n  The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 x ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 x ULN is unknown.\n\n  ## 5.4 Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Radium Ra 223 Dichloride\n\n  Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone is not recommended for use in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride outside of clinical trials.\n\n  The clinical efficacy and safety of concurrent initiation of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and radium Ra 223 dichloride was assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study (ERA-223 trial) in 806 patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases. The study was unblinded early based on an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation.\n\n  At the primary analysis, increased incidences of fractures (28.6% vs 11.4%) and deaths (38.5% vs 35.5%) have been observed in patients who received abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride compared to patients who received placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone.\n\n  ## 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n  The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with abiraterone acetate and for 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1](#LINK_90bc3c3f-1d14-4edd-9266-0c9c2f6700dc), [8.3)](#LINK_eb5e7958-4b6f-4789-a7b8-bef038a3771a)] . Abiraterone acetate should not be handled by females who are or may become pregnant [see [How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)](#LINK_ca475d50-0e3b-4d61-b1f5-e81f6025c38f)] .\n\n  ## 5.6 Hypoglycemia\n\n  Severe hypoglycemia has been reported when abiraterone acetate was administered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving medications containing thiazolidinediones (including pioglitazone) or repaglinide [see [Drug Interactions (7.2)](#LINK_471176de-1ae7-4a84-b3ee-4eacc8ae4562)] . Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes during and after discontinuation of treatment with abiraterone acetate. Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.\n* [6 ADVERSE REACTIONS](#)\n\n  The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n  + Hypokalemia, Fluid Retention, and Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions due to Mineralocorticoid Excess [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#LINK_288a8a57-cea5-4971-9f5e-6c3356b0d817)] .\n  + Adrenocortical Insufficiency [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](#LINK_a762596d-dffa-42b1-bd5e-76c30b1b6913)] .\n  + Hepatotoxicity [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#LINK_47803f60-6820-4cc4-8471-3ab60a660306)] .\n  + Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Radium Ra 223 Dichloride [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.4)](#LINK_6cacf5a1-9da0-4e9c-bb22-5ac85630ed53)] .\n\n  ## 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience\n\n  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n\n  Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-‑302) enrolled patients who had metastatic CRPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. A third randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (LATITUDE) enrolled patients who had metastatic high-risk CSPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg once daily. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2,230 patients in the 5 randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1 to 4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1 to 4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms.\n\n  In the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for abiraterone acetate-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occurred more commonly (>2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3 to 4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of abiraterone acetate and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders.\n\n  Deaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the abiraterone acetate arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in ≥5 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration.\n\n  COU-AA-301: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy    \n   COU-AA-301 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT ≥2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases were excluded if AST and/or ALT >5 x ULN.\n\n  Table 1 shows adverse reactions on the abiraterone acetate arm in COU-AA-301 that occurred with a ≥2% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo or were events of special interest.

Grade 3 to 4 cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 4 deaths. Grade 3 to 4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.\n\n  In the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms.\n\n  ## 6.2 Postmarketing Experience\n\n  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\n  Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: non-infectious pneumonitis.\n\n  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.\n\n  Hepatobiliary Disorders: fulminant hepatitis, including acute hepatic failure and death.\n\n  Cardiac Disorders: QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (observed in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions).\n\n  Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions that include, but are not limited to difficulty swallowing or breathing, swollen face, lips, tongue or throat, or an itchy rash (urticaria)).\n* [7 DRUG INTERACTIONS](#)\n\n  ## 7.1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes\n\n  Based on in vitro data, abiraterone acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4.\n\n  In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate dosing frequency [see [Dosage and Administration (2.5)](#LINK_2a13b7e1-82d8-45e8-8333-e79a9a27ff15)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  ## 7.2 Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes\n\n  Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the C max and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with abiraterone acetate [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)and [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)](#LINK_28222848-3a92-492f-b69f-950b91c1462c)] .\n* [8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS](#)\n\n  ## 8.1 Pregnancy\n\n  Risk Summary   \n   The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate have not been established in females. Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy.\n\n  There are no human data on the use of abiraterone acetate in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose (see Data ).\n\n  Data   \n   Animal Data    \n   In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6 to 17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses), fetal developmental delay (skeletal effects) and urogenital effects (bilateral ureter dilation) at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal ano-genital distance at ≥30 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg/kg/day. Doses ≥10 mg/kg/day caused maternal toxicity. The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the AUC in patients.\n\n  ## 8.2 Lactation\n\n  Risk Summary   \n   The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate have not been established in females. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production.\n\n  ## 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\n  Contraception   \n   Males    \n   Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the final dose of abiraterone acetate [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#LINK_90bc3c3f-1d14-4edd-9266-0c9c2f6700dc)] .\n\n  Infertility    \n   Based on animal studies, abiraterone acetate may impair reproductive function and fertility in males of reproductive potential [see [Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)](#LINK_7b4a396a-28da-41a3-8a25-7d79296cce7c)] .\n\n  ## 8.4 Pediatric Use\n\n  Safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n  ## 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\n  Of the total number of patients receiving abiraterone acetate in randomized clinical trials, 70% of patients were 65 years and over and 27% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n  ## 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n\n  The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate increased by approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n\n  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold and the fraction of free drug increased 2-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n\n  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild hepatic impairment. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily. Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). If elevations in ALT or AST >5 x ULN or total bilirubin >3 x ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate treatment [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#LINK_bc6a98e6-6e1d-416f-9b1c-d2c767f0ccae)and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, interruption of treatment and dosage adjustment may be required [see [Dosage and Administration (2.4)](#LINK_bc6a98e6-6e1d-416f-9b1c-d2c767f0ccae), [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#LINK_47803f60-6820-4cc4-8471-3ab60a660306), and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n\n  ## 8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#LINK_64c410f2-8ed9-4a46-b32b-8abd2e5ee89d)] .\n* [10 OVERDOSAGE](#)\n\n  Human experience of overdose with abiraterone acetate is limited.\n\n  There is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, stop abiraterone acetate, undertake general supportive measures, including monitoring for arrhythmias and cardiac failure and assess liver function.\n* [11 DESCRIPTION](#)\n\n  Abiraterone acetate, USP the active ingredient of abiraterone acetate tablets, USP is the acetyl ester of abiraterone. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase). Each abiraterone acetate tablet, USP contains either 250 mg or 500 mg of abiraterone acetate, USP. Abiraterone acetate, USP is designated chemically as (3β)-acetoxy-17-(3-pyridinyl)androsta-5,16-diene and its structure is:\n\n  Abiraterone acetate, USP is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. Its molecular formula is C 26H 33NO 2 and it has a molecular weight of 391.55 g/mol. Abiraterone acetate, USP is a lipophilic compound with an octanol-water partition coefficient of 5.12 (Log P) and is practically insoluble in water.

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis.\n\n  CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by 17α-hydroxylase activity and 2) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#LINK_288a8a57-cea5-4971-9f5e-6c3356b0d817)] .\n\n  Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.\n\n  Abiraterone acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of abiraterone acetate on serum testosterone levels.\n\n  Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.\n\n  ## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\n  Cardiac Electrophysiology   \n   In a multi-center, open-label, single-arm trial, 33 patients with metastatic CRPC received abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) from baseline. However, small increases in the QTc interval (i.e., <10 ms) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be excluded due to study design limitations.\n\n  ## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n  Following administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone have been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with metastatic CRPC. In vivo, abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels (<0.2 ng/mL) in >99% of the analyzed samples.\n\n  Absorption    \n   Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate to patients with metastatic CRPC, the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations is 2 hours. Abiraterone accumulation is observed at steady-state, with a 2-fold higher exposure (steady-state AUC) compared to a single 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate.\n\n  At the dose of 1,000 mg daily in patients with metastatic CRPC, steady-state values (mean ± SD) of C max were 226 ± 178 ng/mL and of AUC were 993 ± 639 ng.hr/mL. No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 mg to 1,000 mg. However, the exposure was not significantly increased when the dose was doubled from 1,000 to 2,000 mg (8% increase in the mean AUC).\n\n  Effect of Food    \n   Systemic exposure of abiraterone is increased when abiraterone acetate tablet is administered with food. In healthy subjects abiraterone C max and AUC 0-∞ were approximately 7- and 5-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a low-fat meal (7% fat, 300 calories) and approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a high-fat (57% fat, 825 calories) meal compared to overnight fasting. Abiraterone AUC 0-∞ was approximately 7-fold or 1.6-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered 2 hours after or 1 hour before a medium fat meal (25% fat, 491 calories) compared to overnight fasting.\n\n  Systemic exposures of abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC, after repeated dosing of abiraterone acetate were similar when abiraterone acetate was taken with low-fat meals for 7 days and increased approximately 2-fold when taken with high-fat meals for 7 days compared to when taken at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 1 hour before a meal for 7 days.\n\n  Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals, taking abiraterone acetate with meals has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures.\n\n  Distribution    \n   Abiraterone is highly bound (>99%) to the human plasma proteins, albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (mean ± SD) is 19,669 ± 13,358 L.\n\n  Elimination   \n   In patients with metastatic CRPC, the mean terminal half-life of abiraterone in plasma (mean ± SD) is 12 ± 5 hours.\n\n  Metabolism    \n   Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone (active metabolite). The conversion is likely through esterase activity (the esterases have not been identified) and is not CYP mediated. The two main circulating metabolites of abiraterone in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate (inactive) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (inactive), which account for about 43% of exposure each. CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N-oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate.\n\n  Excretion    \n   Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose is recovered in feces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present in feces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the administered dose, respectively).\n\n  Specific Populations    \n   Patients with Hepatic Impairment    \n   The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone was examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose given under fasting conditions increased approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\n  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the mean protein binding was found to be lower in the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group, which resulted in a two-fold increase in the fraction of free drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n  Patients with Renal Impairment    \n   The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on a stable hemodialysis schedule (N=8) and in matched control subjects with normal renal function (N=8). In the ESRD cohort of the trial, a single 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate dose was given under fasting conditions 1 hour after dialysis, and samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 96 hours post dose. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n\n  Drug Interaction Studies    \n   Clinical Studies   \n   Effect of Other Drugs on Abiraterone acetate   \n   Strong CYP3A4 inducers : In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin, 600 mg daily for 6 days) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma AUC ∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.\n\n  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.\n\n  Effect of Abiraterone acetate on Other Drugs   \n   CYP2D6 substrates : The C max and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8-and 2.9-fold, respectively when dextromethorphan 30 mg was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily). The AUC for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of dextromethorphan, increased approximately 1.3 fold.\n\n  CYP1A2 substrates: When abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily) was given with a single dose of 100 mg theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), no increase in systemic exposure of theophylline was observed.\n\n  CYP2C8 substrates: The AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given to healthy subjects with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate.\n\n  In Vitro Studies   \n   Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.\n\n  Transporter Systems: In vitrostudies show that at clinically relevant concentrations, abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and that abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of P-gp.\n\n  In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction.\n* [13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY](#)\n\n  ## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\n\n  A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral abiraterone acetate doses of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day for males and 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day for females. Abiraterone acetate increased the combined incidence of interstitial cell adenomas and carcinomas in the testes at all dose levels tested. This finding is considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of abiraterone. Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats at exposure levels up to 0.8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse.\n\n  Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was not mutagenic in an in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes or an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.\n\n  In repeat-dose toxicity studies in male rats (13- and 26-weeks) and monkeys (39-weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, and hyperplasia in the reproductive system were observed at ≥50 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥250 mg/kg/day in monkeys and were consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone. These effects were observed in rats at systemic exposures similar to humans and in monkeys at exposures approximately 0.6 times the AUC in humans.\n\n  In a fertility study in male rats, reduced organ weights of the reproductive system, sperm counts, sperm motility, altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility were observed in animals dosed for 4 weeks at ≥30 mg/kg/day orally. Mating of untreated females with males that received 30 mg/kg/day oral abiraterone acetate resulted in a reduced number of corpora lutea, implantations and live embryos and an increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. Effects on male rats were reversible after 16 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration.\n\n  In a fertility study in female rats, animals dosed orally for 2 weeks until day 7 of pregnancy at ≥30 mg/kg/day had an increased incidence of irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre-‑implantation loss (300 mg/kg/day). There were no differences in mating, fertility, and litter parameters in female rats that received abiraterone acetate. Effects on female rats were reversible after 4 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration.\n\n  The dose of 30 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day based on body surface area.\n\n  In 13- and 26-week studies in rats and 13- and 39-week studies in monkeys, a reduction in circulating testosterone levels occurred with abiraterone acetate at approximately one half the human clinical exposure based on AUC. As a result, decreases in organ weights and toxicities were observed in the male and female reproductive system, adrenal glands, liver, pituitary (rats only), and male mammary glands. The changes in the reproductive organs are consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone acetate.\n\n  ## 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n\n  A dose-dependent increase in cataracts was observed in rats after daily oral abiraterone acetate administration for 26 weeks starting at ≥50 mg/kg/day (similar to the human clinical exposure based on AUC). In a 39-week monkey study with daily oral abiraterone acetate administration, no cataracts were observed at higher doses (2 times greater than the clinical exposure based on AUC).\n* [14 CLINICAL STUDIES](#)\n\n  The efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate with prednisone was established in three randomized placebo-controlled international clinical studies. All patients in these studies received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer and a history of adrenal gland or pituitary disorders were excluded from these trials. Concurrent use of spironolactone was not allowed during the study period.\n\n  COU-AA-301: Patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy    \n   In COU-AA-301 (NCT00638690), a total of 1,195 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=797) or placebo once daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=398). Patients randomized to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression (defined as a 25% increase in PSA over the patient’s baseline/nadir together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and symptomatic or clinical progression), initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal.\n\n  The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 39 to 95) and the racial distribution was 93% Caucasian, 3.6% Black, 1.7% Asian, and 1.6% Other. Eighty-nine percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 and 45% had a Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form score of ≥4 (patient’s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours). Ninety percent of patients had metastases in bone and 30% had visceral involvement. Seventy percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 30% had PSA-only progression. Seventy percent of patients had previously received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and 30% received two regimens.\n\n  The protocol pre-specified interim analysis was conducted after 552 deaths and showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients treated with abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to patients in the placebo with prednisone arm (Table 9 and Figure 1). An updated survival analysis was conducted when 775 deaths (97% of the planned number of deaths for final analysis) were observed. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (Table 7).\n\n  Table 7: Overall Survival of Patients Treated with Either Abiraterone Acetate or Placebo in Combination with Prednisone in COU-AA-301 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)\n\n       | [\\*](#footnote-reference-17)  p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0 to 1 vs. 2), pain score (absent vs. present), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. 2), and type of disease progression (PSA only vs. radiographic).

Both arms were given concomitant prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical (cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to 3 or more) disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Patients with moderate or severe pain, opiate use for cancer pain, or visceral organ metastases were excluded.\n\n  Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 70 years. The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate was 95% Caucasian, 2.8% Black, 0.7% Asian and 1.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of patients. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Baseline pain assessment was 0 to 1 (asymptomatic) in 66% of patients and 2 to 3 (mildly symptomatic) in 26% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours).\n\n  Radiographic progression-free survival was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria) and/or modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. Analysis of rPFS utilized centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.\n\n  The planned final analysis for OS, conducted after 741 deaths (median follow up of 49 months) demonstrated a statistically significant OS improvement in patients treated with abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to those treated with placebo with prednisone (Table 8 and Figure 2). Sixty-five percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 78% of patients on the placebo arm used subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. Abiraterone acetate was used as a subsequent therapy in 13% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 44% of patients on the placebo arm.\n\n  Table 8: Overall Survival of Patients Treated with Either Abiraterone Acetate or Placebo in Combination with Prednisone in COU-AA-302 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)\n\n       | [\\*](#footnote-reference-19)  p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0 vs. 1).

The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 25.2 months for patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 16.8 months for patients in the placebo arm (HR=0.580; 95% CI: [0.487, 0.691], p < 0.0001).\n\n  The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain was not reached for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and was 23.7 months for patients receiving placebo (HR=0.686; 95% CI: [0.566, 0.833], p=0.0001). The time to opiate use result was supported by a delay in patient reported pain progression favoring the abiraterone acetate arm.\n\n  LATITUDE: Patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC    \n   In LATITUDE (NCT01715285), 1,199 patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC were randomized 1:1 to receive either abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg once daily (N=597) or placebos orally once daily (N=602). High-risk disease was defined as having at least two of three risk factors at baseline: a total Gleason score of ≥8, presence of ≥3 lesions on bone scan, and evidence of measurable visceral metastases. Patients with significant cardiac, adrenal, or hepatic dysfunction were excluded. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or death. Clinical progression was defined as the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to ≥3.\n\n  Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years among all randomized subjects. The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate was 69% Caucasian, 2.5% Black, 21% Asian, and 8.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 55%, 1 for 42%, and 2 for 3.5% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0 to 1 (asymptomatic) in 50% of patients, 2 to 3 (mildly symptomatic) in 23% of patients, and ≥4 in 28% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours).\n\n  A major efficacy outcome was overall survival. The pre-specified interim analysis after 406 deaths showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients on abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to those on placebos. Twenty-one percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 41% of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 618 deaths were observed. The median follow-up time was 52 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre-specified interim analysis (Table 10 and Figure 4).

Melting Point Range: 147°C to 148°C 9. Solubility: Abiraterone acetate is practically insoluble in aqueous media over a wide range of pH values tested (2 - 12) at 20° Celsius and slightly soluble in a 0.1 N HCl solution. Abiraterone acetate is soluble in organic solvents, particularly alcohols. 2.1.2 What are the proposed mechanisms of action and therapeutic indications? Abiraterone acetate is a pro-drug of its active metabolite abiraterone. Abiraterone is an irreversible inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme in the production of androgens in the testes and adrenal glands. CYP17 catalyzes 17α-hydroxylation of C21 [...] adrenal glands. CYP17 catalyzes 17α-hydroxylation of C21 steroids and cleavage of the C17, 20 bond of C21 steroids. The 17α-hydroxylation activity is a step in cortisol biosynthesis, whereas the C17, 20 bond cleavage is needed for subsequent biosynthesis of androgens. The CYP17 enzyme is expressed in testicular and adrenal tissues and catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone or progesterone into DHEA or androstenedione, respectively, which are two precursors of testosterone.

Abiraterone is an irreversible inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme in the production of androgens in the testes and adrenal glands. The proposed indication is the use of abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. A special protocol assessment agreement letter for the pivotal trial # COU-AA-301 was issued on March 28, 2008. The pivotal trial was a phase 3 multi-national, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of abiraterone acetate and prednisone in 1195 patients with mCRPC whose disease had progressed on or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate daily plus 5 mg of prednisone twice daily or placebo plus prednisone using the same dosing regimen, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS) with a median OS of 14.8 months in the abiraterone acetate arm versus 10.9 months in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001) showing a hazard ratio of 0.646. 1.1 Recommendations The Office of Clinical Pharmacology Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology 5 and Pharmacometrics have reviewed the information contained in NDA 202-379. This NDA is considered acceptable from a clinical pharmacology perspective. Labeling Recommendations Please refer to Section 3 - Detailed Labeling Recommendations. 1.2 Phase IV Requirements 1. Conduct a drug-drug interaction trial to evaluate the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole) on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone after an oral dose of abiraterone acetate. The proposed protocol must be submitted for review prior to trial initiation. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 6 2. Conduct a drug-drug interaction trial to evaluate the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., rifampin) on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone after an oral dose of abiraterone acetate. The proposed protocol must be submitted for review prior to trial initiation. 3. Conduct a trial to determine the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone after an oral dose of abiraterone acetate in individuals with severe hepatic impairment. The proposed protocol should contain the rationale for dose selection, and must be submitted for review prior to trial initiation. In the design of the trial, consider development of lower dosage strengths to allow for administration of a safe dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 4. Perform an in vitro screen to determine if abiraterone is an inhibitor of human CYP2C8. Based on results from the in vitro screen, a clinical drug-drug interaction trail may be needed. 1.3 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Findings Abiraterone acetate is a pro-drug of its active metabolite abiraterone. Abiraterone is an irreversible inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme in the production of androgens in the testes and adrenal glands. CYP17 is expressed in testicular and adrenal tissues and catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone or progesterone into dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or androstenedione, respectively, which are 2 precursors of testosterone. The proposed indication is the use of abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. The proposed dosing regimen is 1000 mg administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily. Abiraterone acetate should be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken. A special protocol assessment agreement letter for the pivotal trial # COU-AA-301 was issued on March 28, 2008. The pivotal trial was a phase 3 multi-national, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of abiraterone acetate and prednisone in 1195 patients with mCRPC whose disease had progressed on or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate daily plus 5 mg of prednisone twice daily or placebo plus prednisone using the same dosing regimen, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS) with a median OS of 14.8 months in the abiraterone acetate arm versus 10.9 months in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001) showing a hazard ratio of 0.646. A total of 11 completed studies were used to support the Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Section of the NDA. The single dose studies were performed in healthy volunteers which included seven Phase 1 studies (dose escalation [COU-AA-008], dose proportionality [COU-AA-016], relative bioavailability [COU-AA-010 and COU-AA-014], bioequivalence [COU-AA-005], food effect [COU-AA-009] and mass balance [COU-AA-007]) Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 7 and two organ impairment studies (hepatic [COU-AA-011] and renal [COU-AA-012]). The multiple dose studies were performed in patients with mCRPC, and consist of two Phase 1 studies (CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 drug-drug interaction study [COU-AA-015] and QT/QTc interval study [COU-AA-006]). In vivo, abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed into its active metabolite abiraterone, which then undergoes further metabolism. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) in > 99% of the analyzed samples. The main circulating abiraterone metabolites in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate, accounting for about 43% of exposure each. CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N-oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2D6, in vivo. The systemic exposure of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) as assessed by the ratios of the geometric mean for Cmax and AUC, were approximately 2.8- and 2.9-fold higher, respectively, when dextromethorphan was co-administered with abiraterone acetate. Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate in a human mass balance study, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces and approximately 5% was recovered in urine. Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate in mCRPC patients, the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations (Tmax) is approximately 2 hours and the mean terminal half-life is approximately 12 hours. No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 to 1000 mg. Steady state is achieved within eight days (intensive PK sampling was performed on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1) following once-daily dosing of 1000 mg, with approximately 2-fold higher exposure at steady state (steady state AUC) compared to when the same dose is administered as a single dose. At the dose of 1000 mg daily in patients with mCRPC, steady state mean values of Cmax were 226 ± 178 ng/mL and of AUC were 1173 ± 690 ng.hr/mL. Inter-subject variability was approximately 79% for Cmax and 64% for AUC0-24h after multiple day dosing. A food effect was observed with the geometric mean for abiraterone Cmax and AUC 0-∞ increased by approximately 17- and 10-fold, respectively, when abiraterone acetate was administered with a high-fat meal. In the dedicated hepatic impairment study (COU-AA-011), systemic exposure of abiraterone in the mild hepatic impairment cohort (Child-Pugh Classification A) was comparable to that in the normal hepatic function cohort. Based on geometric mean estimates, the Cmax was 2.7-fold higher and AUC was 3.6-fold higher in the moderate hepatic impairment cohort (Child-Pugh Classification B) compared to the normal hepatic function cohort. The mean T1/2 was approximately 4.6 to 5.5 hours longer for the mild and moderate hepatic impairment cohorts compared to the normal hepatic function cohort. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, a dose reduction to 250 mg once daily is recommended to achieve abiraterone exposures similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function. Abiraterone acetate has not been studied in severe hepatic impairment and we recommend that it should be avoided in these patients. The assessment of abiraterone acetate in severe hepatic impairment will be done as a Phase IV Requirement. In the reduced design dedicated renal impairment study (COU-AA-012), systemic exposure of Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 8 abiraterone after a single oral 1000 mg abiraterone acetate dose was comparable in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis compared to those with normal renal function. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment. There were insufficient exposure data collected in the pivotal phase 3 trial to support evidence of exposure-response for OS and safety endpoints (hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, fluid retention/edema, hypertension). Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were available for only 161 (20%) of the patients in trial COU-AA-301. Limitations in the bioanalytical assay in earlier studies precluded pooling data across clinical trials for safety exposure-response analysis. Since efficacy at lower doses or exposures is unknown, reducing the exposures by could result in a loss of efficacy. It is important to note that both the 750 and 1000 mg doses had similar biomarker activity in study COU-AA-001 (phase 1/2 dose ranging study). The two-step dose reduction was specified in the protocol for study COU-AA-301 to manage hepatotoxicity and other toxicities. The majority of the patients (21/27) followed the step dose reduction scheme in the pivotal trial. Approximately 60% (16/27) of the patients had their dose reduced to 750 mg and did not need further dose reduction. Five patients had step dose reductions from 1000 to 750 to 500 mg. Six patients had a direct dose reduction from 1000-500 mg of which two patients subsequently resumed dosing at 1000 mg. It is not clear whether the four patients that were reduced directly to 500 mg and stayed at that dose would have tolerated 750 mg. Thus, having an option to be treated at the 750 mg dose may reduce the likelihood of experiencing hepatotoxicity while maintaining efficacy.

Abiraterone acetate has been developed as 250 mg immediate-release uncoated tablets for oral administration. It is a white to off-white oval shaped tablet debossed with ‘AA250’. Physical-chemical properties 1. Structural formula: Figure 1: Structural Formula of Abiraterone Acetate and its Active Metabolite, Abiraterone 2. Established names: Abiraterone Acetate , CB7630 3. Molecular Weight: 391.6 Daltons (349.5 for abiraterone) 4. Molecular Formula: C26H33NO2 (C24H31NO for abiraterone) 5. Partition coefficient (log P): 5.12 6. Dissociation Constant (pKa): 5.19 as determined in 0.15M KCl solution 7. Chemical Name: 3β-acetoxy-17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-diene 8. Melting Point Range: 147°C to 148°C 9. Solubility: Abiraterone acetate is practically insoluble in aqueous media over a wide range of pH values tested (2 - 12) at 20° Celsius and slightly soluble in a 0.1 N HCl solution. Abiraterone acetate is soluble in organic solvents, particularly alcohols. 2.1.2 What are the proposed mechanisms of action and therapeutic indications? Abiraterone acetate is a pro-drug of its active metabolite abiraterone. Abiraterone is an irreversible inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme in the production of androgens in the testes and adrenal glands. CYP17 catalyzes 17α-hydroxylation of C21 steroids and cleavage of the C17, 20 bond of C21 steroids. The 17α-hydroxylation activity is a step in cortisol biosynthesis, whereas the C17, 20 bond cleavage is needed for subsequent biosynthesis of androgens. The CYP17 enzyme is expressed in testicular and adrenal tissues and catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone or progesterone into DHEA or androstenedione, respectively, which are two precursors of testosterone. Figure 2: Proposed Abiraterone Acetate and Abiraterone Mechanism of Action Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 10 The applicant claims that since abiraterone is a selective inhibitor of CYP17, it is expected to have improved efficacy and minimized adverse events compared to other anti-androgens due to the reduced risk of non-specific enzyme inhibition affecting the synthesis of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The proposed indication is for abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing a 2.1.3 What are the proposed dosage(s) and route(s) of administration? The applicant proposes a dosing regimen of 1000 mg of oral abiraterone acetate administered once daily at least hour before or hours after food with prednisone 10 mg daily. However, the clinical trial used prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Therefore, the dosing regimen recommended is, 1000 mg administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily. Abiraterone acetate should be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken. 2.2 GENERAL CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 2.2.1 What are the design features of the clinical pharmacology and clinical studies used to support dosing or claims? A single pivotal trial in patients with mCRPC was conducted to support the efficacy claim. Pivotal Phase 3 Trial in Patients with mCRPC (COU-AA-301): Reference ID: 2933046 (b ) (4) (b ) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 11 The pivotal trial was a phase 3 multi-national, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisone in patients with mCRPC whose disease had progressed on or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. This study randomized 1195 patients 2:1 to receive abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone, respectively. Patients received either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg or 4 placebo tablets orally once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. In regions where prednisone was not available, prednisolone was provided. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival and the Table 1 below shows a summary of the results based on this primary endpoint.

The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase 3 protocol (COU-AA-301) was overall survival. Overall survival is an unambiguous endpoint and is generally considered as the gold standard for drug approval in Oncology. In this study, overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death (regardless of cause). Survival time of living subjects was to be censored at the last date a subject was known to be alive or lost to follow up. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were: • time to PSA progression as defined in the PSA working group (PSAWG) criteria; • radiographic PFS based on imaging studies by investigator; • and PSA response rate defined as the proportion of patients achieving a PSA decline of at least 50% according to PSAWG criteria. Comparisons between treatment groups for these three secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted according to Hochberg’s test procedure to adjust for multiple testing. The applicant reported PSA at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter and provided Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses with this endpoint. However, the clear relationship of PSA with survival or benefit is not established. The other efficacy endpoints were: • objective response rate according to modified RECIST criteria; • pain palliation rate based on the Brief Symptom Inventory-Short Form (BSI-SF) worst pain intensity score; • time to pain progression; • time to first SRE; • modified PFS which considers PSA progression, increase in glucocorticoid use, pain progression, a SRE or the initiation of new systemic anticancer therapy as well as radiographic progression; • CTC response rate; • and functional status based on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Prostate (FACT-P). No adjustments for multiple testing were used for these other efficacy endpoints and each comparison between treatment groups used an alpha of 0.05. The other biomarkers explored by the applicant were luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. Consistent with inhibition of CYP17, testosterone concentrations decreased and LH concentrations increased transiently after administration of single dose abiraterone acetate in healthy subjects (Studies COU-AA-008 and COU-AA-016). In subjects with mCRPC, two steroids (deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone), which are upstream of CYP17, and which can serve as biomarkers of the completeness of CYP17 inhibition, reached peak levels at a dose of Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 15 750 mg. Higher abiraterone acetate doses of 1000 mg and 2000 mg did not raise concentrations of these two upstream steroids further (Study COU-AA-001). 2.2.3 Are the active moieties in the plasma (or other biological fluid) appropriately identified and measured to assess pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure response relationships? Yes. All the submitted clinical pharmacology related studies analyzed samples for abiraterone acetate and its active metabolite abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) in > 99% of the analyzed samples. In the mass balance study (COU-AA-007), the mean plasma Cmax and AUC values were approximately 330- and 402-fold higher, respectively, for total radioactivity in plasma than for abiraterone. These results suggest that the majority of circulating total radioactivity after administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate was associated with downstream metabolites of abiraterone (> 92%). A total of 15 metabolites were detected in human plasma with the main circulating metabolites, abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31), accounting for 43.3% and 43.4% of the radioactivity, respectively. These two metabolites are inactive and were not measured in other clinical studies. Exposures of M45 exceeded human exposure at 1000 mg daily in both rat (at 400 mg/kg/day) and monkey (at 1000 mg/kg/day) at the highest administered doses. The exposure of M31 approximated the human exposure at 1000 mg in monkey, although it is approximately 20% of the human exposure in the rat. Exposure-response The applicant conducted two types of exposure-response analysis for effectiveness: • Association of abiraterone exposures to prostate specific antigen (PSA) and then associating PSA dynamics to OS. • Direct relationship between exposures of abiraterone and OS. Because of the ambiguity regarding the appropriateness of PSA as a biomarker in prostate cancer patients, only direct exposure-response analysis relating abiraterone exposures to OS was reviewed. Exploratory exposure-safety analysis for adverse events of interest (hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, fluid retention/edema, and hypertension) is presented in Section 2.2.5 below. 2.2.4 What are the characteristics of the exposure-response relationships (dose-response, concentration-response) for efficacy? There were insufficient exposure data collected in the pivotal trial to support evidence of exposure-response for overall survival (OS). An exploratory exposure-efficacy analysis for OS was conducted using data from the pivotal trial (COU-AA-301) following 1000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate (AA). The observed minimum concentration at steady-state (Cmin_ss) available from 119 patients (15% of the total Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 16 enrolled in the AA arm) was used as the exposure variable. Due to the limited number of patients with observed Cmin_ss levels, exposure data were divided by median into two groups: Cmin_ss ≤ 11.1 ng/ml (N=60) and Cmin_ss > 11.1 ng/ml (N=59). Figure 3 shows no clear separation between the two exposure groups. However, there is a clear treatment effect as both the exposure groups in the treatment arm were well differentiated from the placebo arm. These results were consistent with the applicant’s findings where a Kaplan Meier analysis was conducted using population predicted Cmin_ss and area under the concentration curve at steady state (AUCss ) values from 161 patients (Figure 4 of the Pharmacometrics review in appendix section 4.1). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses did not show Cmin_ss as a predictor of survival while known risk factors like ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) status, baseline lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and prior cytotoxic therapies were significant factors for survival (Table 3).

As described above, there were insufficient PK data collected in the pivotal trial COU-AA-301 to evaluate the exposure-response for the safety endpoints: hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, fluid retention/edema and hypertension. Furthermore, there were no PK data collected in phase 2 studies COU-AA-003 and COU-AA-004. PK data collected in early phase 1/2 studies COU-AA-001 and COU-AA-002 could not be used to generate a pooled safety database because of problems with the bioanalytical assay. Specifically, abiraterone acetate had limited stability in blood and plasma in the absence of sodium fluoride and a metabolite with the same mass transition as abiraterone co-eluted with abiraterone. For Study COU-AA-301, summary statistics of the proportion of patients having adverse events (AEs) by Cmin_ss category are presented in Table 4. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 18 Table 4: Summary of Adverse Events (AEs) by Exposure Group in COU-AA-301 Exposure Group Mean Cmin_ss (ng/ml) Adverse Event Proportion of patients with all grade AE’s (%) Lower (Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 1/60 (1.7) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Elevated ALT 2/59 (3.4) Lower (Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 7/60 (12) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Hypokalemia 11/59 (18) Lower(Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 21/59 (36) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Peripheral edema 16/60 (27) Lower (Below median Cmin_ss) 6.2 9/60 (15) Higher (Above median Cmin_ss) 35.2 Hypertension 5/59 (8.5) 2.2.6 Does this drug prolong the QT or QTc interval? In a multi-center, open-label, single-arm trial, 33 patients with mCRPC received abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (Study # COU-AA-006). Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) from baseline. Serial sets of three time-matched ECGs were obtained on Day -1 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2. When data from Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 were combined, the upper bound of the two-side 90% CI for ΔQTcI from Cycle 1 Day -1 baseline was < 10 ms. The largest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the mean change from baseline was 4.2 ms, observed at 0.5 hours post-dose on Day 1 Cycle 1. In addition, no significant concentration-QT relationship was detected using the pooled data from multiple treatment cycles. No significant QTc prolongation was observed following daily dosing of abiraterone acetate. No major changes in HR, PR interval or QRS interval duration were noted. The therapeutic dose of 1000 mg daily was not sufficient to address the high abiraterone exposure scenarios when patients take 1000 mg daily of abiraterone acetate with a high-fat meal (17- and 10-fold increase in Cmax and AUC 0-∞ , respectively) or when patients taking 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate daily have moderate hepatic impairment (2.7- and 3.6-fold increase in Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 19 Cmax and AUC 0-∞ , respectively). The QT-IRT review stated that the exposure-response relationship trends upward with increasing exposure; however, a 2.6-fold increase in abiraterone exposure has a model predicted ΔQTcI of 1.1 ms (upper 90% CI: 6.6 ms), which is < 10 ms for this exposure scenario. Exposures resulting from administration of abiraterone with a low- or high-fat meal were not explored by QT- IRT as the applicant recommends against administration of abiraterone concomitantly with food. In the food effect trial (COU-AA-009), 8 out of 36 patients had increases from baseline in QTcB interval of > 30 msec: 6 subjects following a low-fat meal (> 31 - 39 msec) and 2 subjects following dosing with a high-fat meal (33 and 36 msec). There were no post-dose vital sign measurements or changes reported as AEs. The mean values in diastolic BP for the high-fat meal group within 0.5 to 12 hours post-dose were from 3 to 8 mmHg lower than corresponding pre-dose values. 2.2.7 Is the dose and dosing regimen selected by the applicant consistent with the known relationship between dose-concentration-response, and are there any unresolved dosing or administration issues? The applicant states that a dose of 1000 mg dosed at least hour before or hours after food was selected because it offered the most consistent pharmacological and endocrinologic effect and the following were considered: • A near maximal increase was observed in the mean deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone (steroids upstream of CYP17 that may serve as biomarkers of the completeness of CYP17 inhibition) levels at the 750 mg dose whereas higher doses of 1000 mg and 2000 mg did not further raise the levels. Testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were below the lower limit of detection at the three doses. • No dose limiting toxicities were observed up to a dose of 2000 mg and a maximum tolerated dose was not determined in early studies. • The safety profile was considered manageable at the 1000 mg dose level (Study COU-AA-301). • A marked food effect was observed (Studies COU-AA-001 and COU-AA-BE). Pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug and its major metabolites 2.2.8 What are the single dose and multiple dose PK parameters? Single Dose PK in Healthy Volunteers Abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone after oral administration. Abiraterone exhibits approximately linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 250 to 1000 mg. Based on the applicant’s non compartmental PK analyses from the healthy volunteer studies (Table 5): • The median abiraterone Tmax occurs around 2 hours post-dose. • Abiraterone exhibits a bi-exponential PK profile with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 15.2 hours, with means across studies ranging from 12.7 to 19 hours. Reference ID: 2933046 (b ) (4) (b ) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 20 • Abiraterone exposure after a 1000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate had an overall mean (across studies) Cmax of 93.5 ng/mL and AUC∞ of 503 ng*h/mL. • High variability was observed with between-subject variability ranging from 32.7% to 119.8% for Cmax and from 40.5% to 140.6% for AUC∞.

Blood samples for PK analysis of abiraterone were collected at pre-dose (within 0.5 hour prior to dose) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose in all the studies. PK in mCRPC Patients In Study COU-AA-006, 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate was administered once daily along with 5 mg of prednisone twice daily. PK samples were collected in Cycle 1 (28 day treatment cycles) on Days 1 and 8 at pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose and on Days 6 and 7 at pre-dose. In Cycle 2 PK samples were only collected on Day 1 using the same schedule as on Cycle 1 Day 1. Single Dose: The Cycle 1 Day 1 mean Cmax and AUC∞ values were 1.95- and 1.58- fold higher, respectively, than those reported in healthy subject studies with comparable median Tmax values of approximately 2 hours (Table 6) . Inter-subject variability in subjects with mCRPC was approximately 140% for Cmax and 101% for AUC∞. Multiple Dose: In Study COU-AA-006, steady state concentrations were achieved by Day 8 of daily dosing (intensive PK sampling was performed on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1). A mean abiraterone accumulation ratio of 2 was observed at steady state (Figure 4). Inter-subject variabilities were approximately 79% for Cmax and 64% for AUC0-24h after multiple day dosing which were lower than the variabilities seen after a single dose. The single and multiple dose PK parameters are summarized in Table 6 below.

Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. 2.2.9 How does the PK of the drug and its major active metabolites in healthy volunteers compare to that in patients? In Study COU-AA-006, mean abiraterone Cmax and AUC∞ values after a single dose of abiraterone acetate were 1.95- and 1.58- fold higher, respectively, than those reported in healthy subject studies. The median Tmax values were approximately 2 hours in healthy volunteers and patients. High variability was observed in both the healthy volunteer studies and the studies with patients. Inter-subject variabilities in patients with mCRPC were approximately 140% for Cmax and 107% for AUC0-24h for the single dose PK. Inter-subject variabilities in healthy volunteer Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 22 studies ranged from 32.7% to 119.8% for Cmax and from 40.5% to 140.6% for AUC∞. Although the mean exposures appear higher in patients, the results are confounded by the use of fasting (over night fast and no food for 4 hours post dose) in healthy volunteer studies versus the use of modified fasting (no food for at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after dose) in the patient studies. The use of prednisone (weak CYP3A4 inducer) in the patient studies maybe a confounding factor, although CYP3A4 induction would have the opposite effect resulting in lower abiraterone exposures in patients when compared with healthy volunteers. However, the difference in exposures between patients and healthy volunteers is within the limits of inter-individual variability observed for abiraterone and is likely not clinically relevant. 2.2.10 What are the characteristics of drug absorption? Abiraterone acetate is converted into the active metabolite abiraterone with a mean Tmax for abiraterone of 2 hours. Based on in vitro studies using Caco-2 cell monolayers, both abiraterone and abiraterone acetate have a low apparent permeability and are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Based on the low solubility and permeability, the applicant classifies abiraterone acetate as a BCS Class IV compound. The absolute bioavailability has not been established. In Study COU-AA-009, systemic exposure of abiraterone increased with the administration of food compared to the fasted state. Compared with the fasted state, the geometric mean for abiraterone Cmax and AUC 0-∞ increased by approximately 7- and 5-fold, respectively, when administered with a low-fat meal and by approximately 17- and 10-fold, respectively, when administered with a high-fat meal. The median abiraterone Tmax and mean T1/2 were not affected by administration of food (Table 21). In Study COU-AA-010, systemic exposures of abiraterone were approximately 4.5-fold higher when abiraterone acetate was administered as an oral liquid olive oil formulation compared with oral tablets (Table 7). The Tmax and T1/2 were comparable with both formulations. The results from these two studies indicate that fat increases the bioavailability of abiraterone following administration of abiraterone acetate tablets.

Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 23 Plasma Protein Binding Abiraterone is highly bound to human plasma proteins (98.8 to 99.9%). It is highly bound to both human serum albumin (HSA) ranging from 95.6 to 99.9% and human α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) ranging from 89.4 to 95.7%. Plasma protein binding of abiraterone acetate has not been investigated. In Study # 8202266 ultrafiltration was used, in vitro, to determine the extent of binding of C-abiraterone (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 µM) to plasma proteins in rat, monkey and human plasma and in solutions of isolated plasma proteins HSA and AAG. In human plasma, the plasma protein binding of 14C –abiraterone was determined to be 98.8 to 99.1% and was found to be concentration independent in the range studied. A mean Cmax of approximately 0.64 nM is observed in clinical studies at a dose of 1000 mg which is included in the concentration range for this protein binding study. Abiraterone was highly bound to 45 mg/mL of HSA (95.6% to 97.6%) and 1 mg/mL of human AAG (94.3% to 95.7%). In Study # FK7603 equilibrium dialysis was used, in vitro, to determine the extent of binding of 14C-abiraterone to plasma proteins in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and human plasma ( 175, 350 and 1750 ng/mL about 0.5 – 5 µM) and in solutions of 43 mg/mL HSA and 0.7 – 2.0 mg/mL AAG (1750 ng/mL). The binding of 14C-abiraterone was determined to be 99.9% to human plasma, 99.9% to HSA and 89.4 to 94.4% to human AAG. Equilibrium in vitro analysis (Study # FK7448) was also used with plasma samples obtained from the hepatic impairment trial (COU-AA-011) that enrolled volunteers with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The unbound fraction (fu) of abiraterone in the plasma of subjects with mild hepatic impairment, moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function was 0.22 ± 0.12%, 0.19 ± 0.06 % and 0.19 ± 0.07% respectively (99.8% protein binding irrespective of hepatic function). Considering hepatic clearance may be affected by fu ( CLh= Qh * (CLint * fu/ Qh + [CLint * fu]), this analysis was performed to ensure that the results observed in the hepatic impairment trial were not confounded by fu as protein binding may be affected in hepatically impaired individuals. The results of this analysis indicate that the conclusions were not confounded by protein binding and that protein binding did not change based on hepatic function. Blood to Plasma Ratio In the human mass balance study COU-AA-007, the mean whole blood to plasma AUC0-∞ ratio (AUCR) was 0.523, indicating that the radioactivity was preferentially retained in the plasma component of blood. Tissue Distribution The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vd) is 19 669 ± 13 358 L, which may suggest that abiraterone is extensively distributed to peripheral tissues. The Vd may be overestimated due to the likely low bioavailability of abiraterone acetate. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 24 Transporter Proteins Based on in vitro studies with Caco-2 cells, abiraterone and abiraterone acetate are not substrates for P-gp. Abiraterone has little inhibition effect on P-gp whereas abiraterone acetate inhibits P-gp significantly, with an IC50 of 10.8 μM in vitro. However, since abiraterone acetate was not detectable in the plasma of most human PK samples collected, the likelihood of an in vivo interaction is low. No studies have been conducted with other transporter proteins. 2.2.12 Does the mass balance study suggest renal or hepatic as the major route of elimination? The phase 1, open-label, single dose, mass balance study of 14C labeled abiraterone acetate in healthy male subjects suggests that renal is a minor route of elimination. Eight healthy male volunteers received a single dose of 1000 mg (approximately 100 μCi) of 14C-labeled abiraterone acetate (Figure 5). • The mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 93% with approximately 5% recovered in urine and 88% recovered in feces. • The main metabolite excreted in urine N-oxide-abiraterone sulfate (M31) was present at approximately 4% of the dose and neither abiraterone acetate nor abiraterone were detected in the urine. • The major components in feces included unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone at approximately 55% and 22% of the dose, respectively. • The mean CLR value of 1.44 L/hr was less than the typical glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney (approximately 7.5 L/hr). Figure 5: Mean Cumulative Percent of Radioactive Dose Recovered in Urine and Feces at Specified Intervals after a Single 1000 mg (100 µci) Oral Dose of [14C]-Abiraterone Acetate to Healthy Male Subjects in Study COU-AA-007. The absolute bioavailability of abiraterone acetate is unknown. Compared to other studies, the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) values for abiraterone are significantly lower in this study (10 fold lower). The applicant states that this may be because the regular formulation is micronized and has excipients that were not used in this non-micronized radioactive drug Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 25 material. These two factors may confound the results of the mass balance study. However, since neither abiraterone acetate nor abiraterone are detected in urine it is likely that the renal route is not a significant route of elimination and abiraterone undergoes extensive metabolism. In addition, CLR (amount of drug excreted in the urine/AUC0-∞) was far less than GFR (1.4 vs. 7.5 L/hr). 2.2.13 What are the characteristics of drug metabolism? Abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone and the conversion is likely through esterase activity (the applicant has not identified esterases involved) and is not mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP). The main circulating metabolites in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31), accounting for about 43% of exposure each (about 87% together). Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 is involved in the formation of the phase 1 metabolites, SULT2A1 is predominantly involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate metabolites and UGT1A4 is predominantly involved in the formation of abiraterone glucuronide metabolites. In vitro Metabolic Profiling and Identification 14C-Abiraterone acetate was stable in human plasma over a 120-second incubation period at 37ºC and the applicant states that this suggests that esterases in human plasma are not responsible for the conversion of 14C –abiraterone acetate to 14C –abiraterone. However, the esterases responsible for the conversion have not been identified. Experiment # 8202268 was performed to determine the specific involvement of CYP450, UGT and SULT isoenzymes in the metabolism of 14C-Abiraterone using human hepatic microsomes, cytosol and recombinant human isoenzymes. • The conversion of 14C –abiraterone acetate (5 µM) to 14C-abiraterone (deacetylation) in human hepatic microsomes (0.5 mg/mL) was rapid, with conversion nearly complete after 0.33 minutes of incubation. This conversion did not require NADPH suggesting that it was not CYP mediated. • Seven metabolites were identified for 14C –abiraterone in pooled human hepatic microsomes and cytosol. • CYP3A4 was involved in the formation of the in vitro phase 1 metabolites designated as CYP M1, M2, M3 and M4. • SULT2A1 was predominantly involved in the formation of the abiraterone sulphate metabolite designated SULT M1. • UGT1A4 was predominantly involved in the formation of abiraterone glucuronide metabolites designated UGT M1 and M2 with a minor contribution of UGT1A3. Experiment # 400380 was performed to profile and tentatively elucidate the structure of metabolites following abiraterone acetate incubation with human cryopreserved hepatocytes. The results indicated, that the major in vitro biotransformation pathway of abiraterone acetate in human was its deacetylation producing abiraterone (CB7598) followed by sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation, alone or in combination with oxidation and mono and dioxidation of Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 26 abiraterone. Experiment # FK7389 investigated the in vitro metabolism of abiraterone acetate in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of male and female mouse, male and female rat, male dog, female rabbit, male monkey and human. • The metabolism of 14C-abiraterone acetate with regard to the disappearance of the parent drug was extensive since within less than 5 minutes all abiraterone acetate was completely converted to abiraterone by ester hydrolysis in all animal and human microsomes and hepatocytes tested. • In liver microsomes, 9 metabolites (coded M2, M3, M4, M5, M8, M11, M13, M14 and M15) were detected. Major human metabolites were M14, M8 and M11. M3 and M15 were minor human metabolites. M14 and M8 were also major metabolites in male rat and dog microsomes. • In hepatocytes, 10 metabolites (coded M1, M2, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M12 and M14) were detected. In most animal (except male mouse and dog) and human hepatocytes, M12 (abiraterone sulfate) was clearly the major metabolite. (The major metabolites also identified in the human mass balance study are shown in Figure 6 in red boxes) • The major in vitro metabolic pathway of abiraterone acetate in man was ester hydrolysis producing abiraterone followed by O-sulfate conjugation (M12) or followed by mono- (M11 and M14) and di-oxidation (M8), which could include hydroxylation as well as N-oxidation. • The in vitro metabolic profiles in human and monkey were qualitatively as well as quantitatively comparable. Figure 6: The Proposed Major In Vitro Metabolic Pathways. The Major Metabolites Identified in the Human Mass Balance Study, Abiraterone Sulphate and N-oxide Abiraterone Sulphate are shown in red. The purpose of Experiment # 8216184 was to determine the concentrations of radioactivity and the purpose of Experiment # 8216188 was to profile and identify the metabolites in blood, plasma, urine and fecal samples and the percent of dose in urine and fecal samples collected Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 27 from eight healthy male subjects in Study COU-AA-007. Plasma, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-dose and up to 96 hours post dose. • In Study COU-AA-007, the mean plasma exposures were approximately 400 fold higher for total radioactivity in plasma than for abiraterone suggesting that the majority of circulating total radioactivity was associated with downstream metabolites of abiraterone (92.4%). • A total of 15 metabolites were detected in human plasma using LC-MS/MS and/or radio-HPLC analysis with the main circulating metabolites, abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31), accounting for 43.3% and 43.4% of the radioactivity, respectively (Table 8). • The other detectable metabolites each accounted for 0.3 to 1.7% of the total radioactivity AUC0-8. • The maximum mean concentrations of drug-derived radioactivity in blood and plasma were observed at 4 hours post-dose. • The mean T1/2 values of the major metabolites M31 and M45 were 21.6 hours and 2.47 hours, respectively. The applicant states that the half-life of M31 maybe overestimated due to limited sampling time with the AUC calculated up to 8 hours.

Elimination In Study COU-AA-007, a mean of 87.9% of the dose was recovered in feces and 5.3% was recovered in urine through the last collection interval. The mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 93%. Urine and fecal samples were collected at the intervals of -12 - 0 hours (pre-dose) and 0 - 6, 6 -12, 12 - 24, 24 - 48, 48 - 72, 72 – 96 hours post dose and at 24 hour intervals until clinic discharge criteria (2 samples below the limit of quantification or ≥ 90% of dose recovered) were met. In the absence of absolute bioavailability data, 88% of drug in feces may suggest limited systemic absorption of abiraterone acetate and not that the fecal/biliary route is the major route of excretion. However, since 4% of the dose was excreted in urine as the metabolite M31 with neither abiraterone acetate nor abiraterone Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 28 detected in the urine, it is likely that limited unchanged drug is eliminated renally and the drug undergoes extensive metabolism. Clearance The apparent steady-state CL of abiraterone in patients estimated using non compartmental PK analyses is 1198 ± 782 L/hr. The apparent steady-state Vd of abiraterone is estimated as 19 669 ± 13 358 L. Half-life Abiraterone exhibits a bi-exponential PK profile with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 12 hours in patients with mCRPC. 2.2.15 Based on PK parameters, what is the degree of linearity or non-linearity based in the dose-concentration relationship? The doses of 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg were evaluated in 2 studies (Studies COU-AA-008 and COU-AA-016). The PK of abiraterone appears to increase with an increase in dose with no major deviations from dose proportionality. Although the analysis of dose proportionality is confounded due to the presence of large inter-individual variability in exposure, there does not appear to be a major deviation from dose proportionality. Study COU-AA-008 was a dose escalation study designed to evaluate PK and safety of single dose abiraterone acetate in healthy adult male subjects. Systemic exposure of abiraterone generally increased with an increase in abiraterone acetate dose up to 1000 mg, but no formal statistical assessment of dose-proportionality was done. Study COU-AA-016 was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study to evaluate the effect of dose on the PK of abiraterone in healthy adult male subjects. Systemic exposure as measured by Cmax, AUClast and AUC∞ increased with increasing dose (Table 9). Table 9: Mean (±SD) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Abiraterone after Single Doses of Abiraterone Acetate Ranging from 250 – 1000 mg in Healthy Fasting Subjects in Study COU-AA-016.

The 90% confidence intervals did not fall into the 80 – 125% range for the AUC at 750 and 1000 mg although some overlap could be seen. Inter-subject variability was relatively high, with CVs Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 29 ranging from 49.8 to 63.4% for Cmax and from 42.0 to 55.8% for the AUCs. Intra-subject variability for most subjects was approximately 31% for AUC∞ and 42% for Cmax. Table 10: Statistical Analysis of Dose-Normalized Pharmacokinetic Parameters Estimated After Single Doses of Abiraterone Acetate Ranging from 250 – 1000 mg in Healthy Fasting Subjects in Study COU-AA-016. PK Parameter Dose LS Mean (normalized to 250 mg) Test/Reference Ratio (%) 90% CI Cmax (ng/mL) 250 ( Reference) 31.33 500 29.83 95.23 (79.02, 114.77) 750 26.12 83.39 (69.20, 100.49) 1000 25.68 81.98 (68.02, 98.80) AUC∞ (hr*ng/mL) 250 181.16 500 160.54 88.62 (77.00, 102.00) 750 139.85 77.20 (67.09, 88.83) 1000 140.36 77.48 (67.32, 89.17) Parameter data were natural log (ln) transformed and dose normalized prior to analysis. The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer applied a power model to test dose proportionality. The results suggested that the slope for the power model on logarithmic scale for AUC is 0.80 with a 90% confidence interval of (0.69, 0.92), which is overlapped with the confidence interval of (0.8, 1.25). Although the analysis of dose proportionality is confounded due to the presence of large inter-individual variability in exposure, there does not appear to be a major deviation from dose proportionality. Figure 7: Log AUC (ng*hr/mL) Plotted Against Log of Dose (mg) in the Dose Proportionality Study COU-AA-016 in the Dose Range of 250 to 1000 mg. The dotted lines indicate the confidence interval around the estimates 2.2.16 How do the PK parameters change with time following chronic dosing? A mean abiraterone accumulation ratio of 2 was observed at steady state with similar exposures on Day 1 of Cycle 2 (28 day treatment cycles) as compared to Day 8 of Cycle 1 after daily Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 30 dosing. In mCRPC patients, inter-subject variability was approximately 79% for Cmax and 64% for AUC24h after multiple day dosing compared to 140% for Cmax and 107% for AUC24h after a single dose in mCRPC patients. 2.2.17 What is the inter- and intra-subject variability of PK parameters in volunteers and patients, and what are the major causes of variability? High variability was observed with between-subject variability ranging from 32.7% to 119.8% for Cmax and from 40.5% to 140.6% for AUC in healthy volunteers. Inter-subject variability was approximately 79% for Cmax and 64% for AUC24h after multiple day dosing compared to 140% for Cmax and 107% for AUC24h after a single dose in mCRPC patients. The applicant describes the absorption of abiraterone acetate as complex and highly variable. The large variability seen is likely due to abiraterone acetate having low solubility and permeability (BCS Class IV). BCS Class IV drugs are generally considered to have poor and highly variable bioavailability. In study COU-AA-009, the inter-subject variability (CV %) in the exposure parameters decreased with administration of food, specifically with increasing fat content. Inter-subject variabilities of 72, 55 and 37 % were observed for AUC0-∞ when abiraterone was taken under fasting conditions, with a low fat meal and with a high fat meal, respectively. However, since it is impractical to standardize meals in clinical practice a large variability in exposure may be seen if abiraterone acetate is dosed with a meal, because a high fat meal increases the AUC 10-fold and a low fat meal increases the AUC 4-fold when compared to fasting conditions (overnight fast and fast for 4 hours post-dose). The impact of modified fasting (fast atleast 2 hours before and 1 hour after dose) that was used in the studies in mCRPC patients and is proposed for use clinically is unclear based on the data submitted in the submission. 2.3 INTRINSIC FACTORS 2.3.1 What intrinsic factors (age, race, weight, height, genetic polymorphisms and organ dysfunction) influence exposure (PK usually) and/or response, and what is the impact of any differences in exposure on efficacy or safety responses? No formal studies have been conducted to assess the effect of age, race, weight, height or genetic polymorphisms on exposure and response. The applicant’s population pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) model did not identify weight or age as covariates on clearance. The effect of race was difficult to assess using a Pop PK approach as > 93% of the patients were Caucasian in the clinical trials. Relationship between Race and Exposure The potential effects of race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were not formally investigated. The vast majority of subjects enrolled in the clinical studies were Caucasian males Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 31 (> 93 %). The reason for this is unclear. The incidence of prostate cancer is higher in Blacks/African Americans compared to other races (234.6 per 100000 men in Blacks compared to 150.4 per 100,000 men in Caucasians). In addition, abiraterone acetate is a SULT2A1 substrate. SULT2A1 polymorphisms associated with decreased activity and expression have been identified in African Americans (BA Thomae et al. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2(1): 48-56 and Wilborn TW et al. J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2006; 99(4-5):209-14). Considering, the number of African Americans in the clinical studies was very limited and no genotyping was performed in the clinical trials, the influence of the polymorphisms is difficult to determine. Relationship between Weight and Exposure No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone based on weight. Figure 8 shows the weight of 119 patients from Study COU-AA-301 divided into quartiles against observed steady-state Cmin values. Figure 9 shows 33 patients from Study COU-AA-006, with the steady-state AUC plotted against weight (75 - 135 kg).

The geometric mean Cmax was approximately 16% lower than that in the normal hepatic function cohort, while the geometric mean AUC was approximately 1.1 fold higher. Based on geometric mean estimates, the Cmax was 2.7 higher and AUC was 3.6 fold higher in the moderate hepatic impairment group (Child-Pugh Classification B) compared to the normal hepatic function group. The mean elimination T1/2 was approximately 4.6 to 5.5 hours longer for the mild and moderate hepatic impairment cohorts compared to the normal hepatic function cohort (Table 11 and 12). Large inter-subject variability in Cmax, AUClast, and AUC∞ was seen in all cohorts (CV = 84% [52 – 115]).

Plasma samples were collected up to 96 hours post-dose. The unbound fractions of abiraterone in plasma were similar among subjects with mild hepatic impairment, moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function with values of 0.22 ± 0.12%, 0.19 ± 0.06 % and 0.19 ± 0.07% respectively (99.8% protein binding irrespective of hepatic function). Considering hepatic clearance may be affected by fu (CLh= Qh * (CLint * fu/ Qh + [CLint * fu]), the results of this protein binding study indicate that the conclusions from the hepatic study were not confounded by protein binding because protein binding did not change based on hepatic function. Relationship between Renal Impairment and Exposure: In a dedicated open-label reduced design study (COU-AA-012), the mean abiraterone PK parameters were comparable between volunteers with normal renal function (N=8) and those with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (N=8). Table 14 shows the PK parameters following administration of abiraterone acetate to the volunteers without renal impairment (healthy volunteer cohort) or to the volunteers with ESRD. The data from one patient were removed from the normal renal function group because the patient had abiraterone exposures which were 5 to 6 fold higher than the mean exposure in the group. In this study a 1000 mg dose was given 1 hour after dialysis and samples were collected up to 96 hours post dose. Theoretically, this study design may not completely rule out the possibility that severe renal impairment or ESRD may have effects on the PK of abiraterone. Since the patients underwent dialysis shortly before abiraterone acetate administration, the dialysis may have acted to reduce the potential effect of ESRD on the PK of abiraterone. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 35 Table 13: Mean (±SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Abiraterone after Administration of 1000 mg Abiraterone Acetate Daily in Healthy Volunteers with ESRD and Healthy Volunteers without Renal Impairment in Study COU-AA-012 Parameters ESRD (N = 8) Normal Renal Function (N = 8) Cmax (ng/mL) 50.2 ± 37.7 104 ± 124 Tmaxa (hr) 3.00 (1.00, 6.00) 1.50 (1.00, 4.00) AUC0-last (ng*hr/mL) 305 ± 267 485 ± 513 AUC0-∞ (ng*hr/mL) 315 ± 265 497 ± 523 T1/2 (hr) 16.0 ± 2.00 19.0 ± 4.08 CL/F (L/hr) 5060 ± 3034 3168 ± 1638 Vd/F (L) 118926 ± 74377 80346 ± 32619 Plasma samples were collected up to 96 hours post-dose.

Plasma samples were collected up to 96 hours post-dose. 2.3.2 Based upon what is known about exposure-response relationships and their variability and the groups studied, healthy volunteers vs. patients vs. specific populations, what dose adjustments, if any, are recommended for each of these groups? If dose adjustments are not based upon exposure-response relationships, describe the alternative basis for the recommendation. Pediatric patients Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. Renal impairment In a dedicated open label reduced design study (COU-AA-012), the mean abiraterone PK parameters were comparable between the patients with normal renal function and those with ESRD on hemodialysis. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 36 Hepatic impairment In a dedicated hepatic study (COU-AA-011), the systemic exposure of abiraterone for the mild hepatic impairment cohort (Child-Pugh Classification A) was comparable to that for the normal hepatic function cohort. Based on geometric mean estimates, the Cmax was 2.7 fold higher and AUC was 3.6 fold higher in the moderate hepatic impairment group (Child-Pugh Classification B) compared to the normal hepatic function group. Large inter-subject variability in Cmax and AUC∞ was seen in all cohorts (CV = 84% [52 – 115]). A dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment as the systemic exposure of abiraterone was comparable to that in individuals with normal hepatic function. The applicant proposes that abiraterone acetate should not be used in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. However, a dose adjustment recommendation is warranted in moderate hepatic impairment to provide patients with an appropriate dose that matches exposures seen in patients with normal hepatic function receiving 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate. The rate of all Grade 3/4 toxicities seen in Study COU-AA-301 was ≤ 1% for the abiraterone acetate group, including hepatotoxicity such as ALT increases. Since frequent LFT monitoring is proposed in the label, the use of abiraterone acetate can be well managed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. A dose reduction from 1000 mg to 280 mg is estimated to adjust for the change in exposure (3.6 fold change in AUC) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Since abiraterone acetate is available as a 250 mg tablet, a dose of 250 mg daily is recommended. Although the 250 mg recommended dose is 11% less than the estimated 280 mg dose, the exposure at the 250 mg dose should be in a similar range as a 280 mg dose as a result of the high inter subject variability in exposure of > 50%. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, the Clinical Pharmacology reviewer recommends that the label state that abiraterone acetate has not been studied in patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment and should be avoided in these patients. A PMR will be requested for the applicant to conduct a study to evaluate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the PK of abiraterone after an oral dose of abiraterone acetate. For this study, the applicant will need to consider development of a lower dosage form in order to allow for administration of a safe dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A dose modification is recommended for any patient that develops hepatotoxicty while on the drug. Across all abiraterone acetate clinical studies, liver function test elevations (ALT or AST increases of > 5 X the upper limit of normal [ULN] or bilirubin increases > 1.5 X ULN) were reported in approximately 2% of patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. The applicant proposes the italicized labeling language below. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 37 In the phase 3 pivotal trial the dose was reduced from 1 000 mg to 750 mg for ALT > 5X ULN and bilirubin > 3X ULN. It is not clear how a dose reduction to 500 mg will affect the efficacy as an exposure response relationship has not been established. In addition, in a biomarker study a near maximal increase was observed in mean deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone (steroids upstream of CYP17 that serve as biomarkers of the completeness of CYP17 inhibition) levels at the 750 mg dose, whereas higher doses of 1000 mg and 2000 mg did not raise the levels. Therefore, based on this patients may benefit from a step dose reduction from 1000 mg to 750 mg and then to 500 mg if not tolerated. Furthermore, in patients that have hepatic impairment at baseline a 50% or 75% dose reduction may be limited by the lowest dosage form of 250 mg. The Clinical Pharmacology reviewer therefore assessed if alternate day dosing would be appropriate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who require a dose reduction due to elevations in ALT > 5 X ULN and bilirubin > 3X ULN. Simulations were performed based on non-parametric superposition using WinNonLin 5.2.1. Figure 8 shows the simulated concentrations comparing a daily dose of 1000 mg to an every other day dose of 1000 mg. The simulation was based on mean plasma concentrations seen with a single dose of a 1000 mg dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The simulation included a dose at 0 and 24 hours for the 1000 mg daily dosing which had a predicted AUC0- 48 of 2210 ng/mL and a 1000 mg dose at 120 and 168 hours for alternate day dosing regimen. The AUC120-168 was predicted as 1209 ng/mL which was approximately half of the exposure seen over 48 hours when two 1000 mg daily doses were used. The simulated Cmax values were similar with the two dosing regimens (162 ng/mL for 1000 mg daily dosing and 150 ng/mL for 1000 mg alternate day dosing). However, it was unclear how the change in dosing regimen would affect the efficacy as the PK/PD relationship of this enzyme inhibitor is unclear. The low concentrations on Day 2 of every other day dosing may not be sufficient for inhibition of the target enzyme (CYP17), and will therefore not be recommended. Figure 12: Simulated Plasma PK Concentration Time Profiles for Daily Dosing and Alternate Day Dosing Predicted From Single Dose Plasma Concentrations In Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Study COU-AA-011) Simulation doses included Time 0 and 24 for daily dosing and 120 and 168 for alternate day dosing. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 38 2.3.3 What pregnancy and lactation use information is there in the application? The safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate have not been established in pregnancy and in lactating women as this drug is for use in men with prostate cancer. 2.4 EXTRINSIC FACTORS 2.4.1 What extrinsic factors (drugs, herbal products, diet, smoking, and alcohol use) influence dose-exposure and/or -response and what is the impact of any differences in exposure on response? The effects of extrinsic factors such as herbal products, diet, smoking and alcohol use on the dose-exposure and/or dose-response for abiraterone acetate were not assessed in a formal study. Drug-drug interactions 2.4.2 Is there an in vitro basis to suspect in vivo drug-drug interactions? As a substrate Abiraterone acetate was converted to abiraterone (deacetylation) in human hepatic microsomes and the conversion did not require NADPH suggesting it is not CYP mediated. Abiraterone is a substrate for CYP3A4, SULT2A1 and UGT1A4. CYP3A4 is involved in the formation of phase 1 metabolites, SULT2A1 is predominantly involved in the formation of the abiraterone sulphate metabolites and UGT1A4 is predominantly involved in the formation of abiraterone glucuronide metabolites. The major metabolites in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate (SULT2A1) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (SULT2A1 and CYP3A4). The PK of abiraterone may be affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, but this has not been evaluted in vivo. As an inhibitor or inducer In vitro studies on human hepatic microsomes showed that abiraterone is a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 (Refer to Table 15). The inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, with the largest I/Ki ratios, by abiraterone was further explored in vivo. Based on the Ki values obtained from in vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes, abiraterone acetate is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5. However, since abiraterone acetate is below the LOQ of 0.2 ng/mL in human plasma, it is unlikely that the interactions with any of the CYPs studied will be clinically meaningful with the [I]/Ki ratio for the most potent CYP2C19 inhibition by abiraterone acetate determined to be < 0.004. Abiraterone acetate also slightly induced CYP1A2 expression and activity in a non-concentration dependent manner. Study # 400378 was performed to determine the potential of abiraterone acetate (0.1 -10 µM) to induce or inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities in primary cultures of Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 39 human hepatocytes. Any effects would unlikely be clinically relevant because abiraterone acetate is undetectable in human plasma. • Abiraterone acetate was shown to be a slight inducer for CYP1A2 activity (1.3% of the induction level of the positive control) in a non concentration-dependent manner. • Abiraterone acetate was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity (30% between 1 and 10 µM; Ki or IC50 not provided) in a non concentration-dependent manner. • Abiraterone acetate had no effect on CYP2C9 activity with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM. Study # 400379 was performed to determine the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C8 was not assessed) by abiraterone acetate (0.1 -10 µM) and abiraterone (0.1 -10 µM). • Abiraterone (CB7598) was a not an inhibitor for human CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 while it was a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 and a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 over the concentrations tested. • Abiraterone acetate (CB7630) exhibited no inhibition towards CYP2A6, but showed a moderate inhibition towards CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 and a potent inhibition towards CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 over the concentration range tested.

Abiraterone is a CYP3A4 substrate, but it has not been evaluated in vivo with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (See Section 2.4.2). Studies with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers will be required as a PMR. 2.4.4 Is the drug an inhibitor and/or an inducer of CYP enzymes? In vitro studies on human hepatic microsomes suggested that abiraterone is a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. The inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 by abiraterone was further explored, in vivo. Based on the Ki values obtained from in vitro studies in human hepatic microsomes, abiraterone acetate is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5. However, since abiraterone acetate is below the LOQ of 0.2 ng/mL in Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 40 human plasma, it is unlikely that the interaction will be clinically meaningful with the [I]/Ki ratio for the most potent CYP2C19 inhibition by abiraterone acetate determined to be < 0.004. The inhibitions of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 were further explored in vivo. Abiraterone acetate also slightly induced CYP1A2 expression and activity in a non-concentration dependent manner in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The interaction potentials between abiraterone acetate and a sensitive substrate of CYP2D6, or abiraterone acetate and a sensitive substrate of CYP1A2 were evaluated in a multi-center, open-label study in subjects with mCRPC (COU-AA-015). The effect of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily on the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan hydrobromide (HBr) ( single dose of 30 mg) was evaluated in Group A. This group consisted of 18 patients who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (ultra metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers were included in this group) at screening. The CYP2D6 status was determined using the xTAGTM Mutation Detection system for P450-2D6 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics). The effect of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on CYP1A2 was assessed using theophylline (single dose of 100 mg) in Group B (n=16). The systemic exposure of dextromethorphan was approximately 3 fold higher based on the ratios of the geometric means for the Test/Reference when dextromethorphan was co-administered with abiraterone acetate. The geometric mean dextrorphan Cmax values were similar in the presence and absence of abiraterone acetate, whereas geometric mean AUC values were approximately 33% higher (1.3 fold higher) when dextromethorphan was co-administered with abiraterone acetate.

Based on in vitro Caco-2 cells, abiraterone and abiraterone acetate are not substrates for P-gp. Abiraterone has little inhibitory effect on P-gp whereas abiraterone acetate inhibits P-gp significantly, with an IC50 of 10.8 μM in vitro. However, since abiraterone acetate was not detectable in human plasma in most PK samples collected the likelihood of an in vivo interaction is low. No studies have been conducted with other transporter proteins. 2.4.6 Does the label specify co-administration of another drug and, if so, has the interaction potential between these drugs been evaluated? Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg is to be used with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. The studies in mCRPC were performed using abiraterone acetate 1000 mg in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction is difficult to assess because all the studies with abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone were performed in patients with mCRPC and no formal drug-drug interaction study has been performed. The healthy volunteer studies that used abiraterone acetate alone have lower mean exposures compared to those seen in mCRPC studies. The increase in exposure in mCRPC compared to healthy volunteers is unlikely due to co-administration of prednisone, as it is a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4. Rather, the difference in exposure between healthy volunteers and mCRPC patients is likely due to multiple other unknown factors which may include differences in dosing with regard to food. In particular, the healthy volunteer studies used overnight fasting before dosing with a 4 hour fast after dosing, while the patients were given the dose 2 hours after or 1 hour before food. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 42 2.4.7 Are there any in vivo drug-drug interaction studies that indicate the exposure alone and/or exposure-response relationships are different when drugs are co-administered? No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with prednisone or any strong CYP inducers/inhibitors. In vivo, abiraterone acetate causes an increase in the exposure of CYP2D6 substrates (3 fold increase on the sensitive substrate dextromethorphan). 2.5 GENERAL BIOPHARMACEUTICS 2.5.1 Based on BCS principles, in what class is this drug and formulation? What solubility, permeability and dissolution data support this classification? Abiraterone acetate (drug substance) can likely be classified as a BCS Class IV drug due to low solubility and low permeability characteristics reported by the applicant. It has not received official BCS classification/designation from the FDA. The solubility studies submitted were performed at 20°C and not 37°C but do suggest that abiraterone acetate (drug substance) has low solubility in aqueous media. Solubility Abiraterone acetate is practically insoluble in aqueous media over a wide range of pH values and slightly soluble in 0.1 N HCl solution. Table 18 includes the solubility results in aqueous media as a function of pH after equilibration for at least 24 hours at 20°C. Table 18: Solubility of Abiraterone Acetate in Aqueous Media as a Function of pH at 20 °C for at least 24 Hours Although the solubility of abiraterone acetate is very limited in aqueous media, it is soluble in organic solvents. Table 19 includes the solubility results in various organic solvents after equilibration for at least 24 hours at 20°C. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 43 Table 19: Solubility of Abiraterone Acetate in Organic Solvents after Equilibration for at least 24 hours at 20°C Permeability Studies performed using Caco-2 cell monolayers indicated that abiraterone acetate and abiraterone have a low apparent permeability. The apparent permeability values of abiraterone acetate are < 3.69 x10-6 cm/s in the A to B direction and < 1.58 x10-6 cm/s in the B to A direction. The apparent permeability of abiraterone is < 3.46 x10-6 cm/s in the A to B direction and < 4.60 x10-6 cm/s in the B to A direction. 2.5.2 What is the composition of the to-be-marketed formulation? The immediate release 250 mg tablets are formulated with microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate as excepients. Table 20: Composition of Immediate Release Abiraterone Acetate 250 mg Tablets Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 44 2.5.3 What moieties should be assessed in bioequivalence studies? The parent compound, abiraterone acetate, and its active metabolite, abiraterone were assessed in all the clinical studies. Since abiraterone acetate was not detectable in most studies and abiraterone is the active moiety, abiraterone will need to be assessed in any bioequivalence studies. 2.5.4 What is the effect of food on the bioavailability (BA) of the drug from the dosage form? What dosing recommendation should be made, if any, regarding administration of the product in relation to meals or meal types? Study COU-AA-009 was a phase 1, single dose, open-label, three-period, crossover study to determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate in healthy male subjects. The three periods tested the effect of fasting (overnight fast and no food for 4 hours post dose), a low fat meal (298.7 total calories of calories with 7.3% from fat) or a high fat meal (total calories of 826.3 with 56.5% from fat) on the PK of abiraterone. PK samples were collected up to 96 hours post dose and a 7 day wash-out was used between treatments. At 1000 mg, systemic exposure of abiraterone, increased with the administration of food compared to the fasted state. The median abiraterone Tmax and mean T1/2 were not affected by administration of food. Compared with the fasted state, the geometric mean for abiraterone Cmax and AUC 0-∞ increased by approximately 7- and 5-fold, respectively, when administered with a low-fat meal and by approximately 17- and 10-fold, respectively, when administered with a high-fat meal (Table 21). Table 21: Estimated Geometric Means and Ratios with Associated 90% CI for Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Abiraterone Comparing Administration of 1000 mg Abiraterone Acetate under Fasting Conditions Versus Administration with Standardized Low-fat or High-fat Meals in Study COU-AA-009. Overall, 12 of the 36 (33.3%) subjects reported Grade 1 or 2 adverse events (AEs). No Grade 3 or 4 AEs or SAEs were reported and no subject was discontinued from the study due to an AE. Eight subjects had increases from baseline in the QTcB interval of > 30 msec: 6 subjects following a low-fat meal (> 31 - 39 msec) and 2 subjects following dosing with a high-fat meal (33 and 36 msec). There were no post-dose vital sign measurements or changes reported as AEs. The mean values in diastolic blood pressure for the high-fat meal group within 0.5 to 12 hours post-dose were from 3 to 8 mmHg lower than corresponding pre-dose values. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 45 In all the single dose studies (healthy volunteer studies), abiraterone acetate was dosed following an overnight fast and no food was allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. In the studies in patients with mCRPC, abiraterone acetate was taken at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal. This latter dosing schedule is proposed by the applicant with 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate tablets taken at least hour before or at least hours after a meal. 2.5.5 Has the applicant developed an appropriate dissolution method and specification that will assure in vivo performance and quality of the product? Yes. 2.6 ANALYTICAL SECTION 2.6.1 Were relevant metabolite concentrations measured in the clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutics studies? Yes. All the submitted clinical pharmacology related studies analyzed samples for abiraterone acetate and its active metabolite abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate concentrations were below detectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) in > 99% of the analyzed samples. The evolution of the LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods for abiraterone and abiraterone acetate in human plasma initially started in 2005. In the mass balance study (COU-AA-007), a total of 15 metabolites were detected in human plasma with the main circulating metabolites, abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31), accounting for 43.3% and 43.4% of the radioactivity, respectively. Radioactivity in the samples was profiled by radio-HPLC and metabolites were identified using co-chromatography with known standards and by using LC-MS/MS methods. An LC-MS/MS research method was developed and used to measure the concentrations of the two main metabolites in human plasma samples (M45 and M31). Reference ID: 2933046 (b ) (4) (b ) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 46 Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone have been analyzed in human urine and fecal samples from Study COU-AA-007 by radio-HPLC. Profiling and identification of metabolites were also performed in plasma, urine and fecal samples. Radioactivity in the samples was profiled by radio-HPLC and metabolites were identified using co-chromatography with known standards and by using LC-MS/MS methods. Plasma samples from a drug-drug interaction study (Study COU-AA-015) were analyzed for dextromethorphan and dextrorphan using a LC-MS/MS method at ( and for theophylline at Table 22: Summary of Bioanalytical Methods Used in Clinical Studies for Pharmacokinetic Measurements of Abiraterone and Abiraterone Acetate Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 47 2.6.2 Which metabolites have been selected for analysis and why? All the submitted clinical pharmacology related studies analyzed samples for abiraterone acetate and its active metabolite abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate concentrations were below detectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) in > 99% of the analyzed samples. The main circulating metabolites, abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31) are considered inactive and were not measured in trials apart from the mass balance trial. 2.6.3 For all moieties measured, is free, bound, or total measured? What is the basis for that decision, if any, and is it appropriate? Abiraterone is highly bound to human plasma proteins (98.8 – 99.9%). The total concentration of abiraterone in plasma was measured in the clinical trials. In Study # COU-AA-011, the values for the unbound fraction of abiraterone in plasma from subjects with mild hepatic impairment, moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function were 0.22 ± 0.12%, 0.19 ± 0.06 % and 0.19 ± 0.07%, respectively (99.8% protein binding irrespective of hepatic function). Therefore, the measurement of total concentrations in all trials is likely appropriate. 2.6.4 What bioanalytical methods are used to assess concentrations? (Refer to the guidance for industry on Bioanalytical Method Validation, http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidan ces/ucm070107.pdf) Plasma abiraterone acetate and its active metabolite abiraterone were analyzed using LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods for plasma samples. Radioactivity in the urine and fecal samples was profiled by radio-HPLC and metabolites were identified using co-chromatography with known standards and by using LC-MS/MS methods. The bioanalytical methods for abiraterone and abiraterone acetate from are summarized in Table 23 below.

How does it relate to the requirements for clinical studies? What curve fitting techniques are used? The validated LC-MS/MS methods for plasma PK analyses by (Study # 8212-170) , Janssen R&D (Study # BA1601) and (Study # BA1656) were used in the Clinical Pharmacology studies submitted in this NDA. Plasma concentrations of abiraterone sulphate (M45) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (M31) plasma samples were analyzed using a method by Janssen R&D (Study # BA1732). A method (Study # P668-ACPB) was used for plasma dextromethorphan concentrations and a method (Study # 2100-555) was used for theophyline plasma PK samples. The analytical methods consist of a low range method (0.2 – 200 ng/mL) and a high range method ( 2 – 2000 ng/mL ) for abiraterone in undiluted samples. The Janssen R&D and analytical methods both consist of a low range method (0.2 – 50 ng/mL) and a high range method (2 – 500 ng/mL) for abiraterone in undiluted samples (Table 23). The mean steady state Cmax seen in patients with mCRPC receiving abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily was 226 ± 178 ng/mL, so the range of concentrations in the clinical trials were in the range of the standard curves for all the analytical methods. In study COU-AA-009, the mean Cmax observed in the high fat meal group was 1270 ± 478 ng/mL. The Janssen R&D method was used to analyze samples in study COU-AA-009. The concentration range in the calibration curve for the Janssen R&D method using diluted samples is 1 – 2500 ng/mL and the concentrations in Study COU-AA-009 were in this range. The methods were appropriate for analyses of abiraterone concentrations in all the trials. Results for abiraterone and abiraterone acetate were calculated using peak area ratios of analyte to internal standard and calibration curves were generated using a weighted (1/x2) linear least-squares regression. The methods had correlation coefficients of the curves ranging from 0.9993 to 0.9999. Results for theophylline, dextromethorphan and dextrophan were calculated using peak area ratios of analyte to internal standard and calibration curves were generated using a weighted (1/x2) linear least-squares regression. Correlation coefficients of the curves ranged from 0.9979 to 0.9989. 2.6.6 What is the QC sample plan? Six replicates of QC samples were performed at each of the LLOQ, low QC, medium QC and high QC concentrations for abiraterone and abiraterone acetate. Intra- and inter-assay results demonstrated a RSD for QC samples to be ≤15.0% (≤20.0% at the LLOQ). 3 DETAILED LABELING RECOMMENDATIONS Only relevant clinical pharmacology sections are included.

There were insufficient exposure data collected in the pivotal trial to support evidence of exposure-response for overall survival (OS). An exploratory exposure-efficacy analysis for OS was conducted using data from the pivotal trial (COU-AA-301) following a 1000 mg dose of AA. The observed Cmin_ss available from 119 patients (15% of the total enrolled in the AA arm) was used as the exposure variable. Due to a limited number of patients with observed Cmin_ss levels, exposure data were divided by median into two groups: Cmin_ss ≤11.1 ng/ml (N=60) and Cmin_ss > 11.1 ng/ml (N=59). Figure 1 shows no clear separation between the two exposure groups. However, there is a clear treatment effect as both the exposure groups in the treatment arm were well differentiated from the placebo arm. These results were consistent with the applicant’s findings where a kaplan meier analysis was conducted using population predicted Cmin_ss and AUCss values from 161 patients (Figure 4). A univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis did not show Cmin_ss as a predictor of survival, while known risk factors like ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) status, baseline lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), prior cytotoxic therapies were significant factors for survival (Table 1).

As described above, there were insufficient PK data collected in the pivotal trial COU-AA-301 to evaluate the exposure-response for the safety endpoints hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, fluid retention/edema, and hypertension. Furthermore, there were no PK data collected in phase 2 studies COU-AA-003 and COU-AA-004. PK data collected in early phase 1/2 studies COU-AA-001 and COU-AA-002 could not be used to generate a pooled safety database because of problems with the bioanalytical assay. Specifically, abiraterone acetate had limited stability in blood and plasma in the absence of sodium fluoride and a metabolite with the same mass transition as abiraterone co-eluted with abiraterone. For Study COU-AA-301, summary statistics of the proportion of patients having adverse events (AEs) by Cmin_ss category are presented in Table 2. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 63 Table 2: Summary of AEs by Exposure Group in COU-AA-301 Exposure Group Mean Cmin_ss (ng/ml) Adverse Event Proportion of patients with all grade AE’s (%) Lower (Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 1/60 (1.7) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Elevated ALT 2/59 (3.4) Lower (Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 7/60 (12) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Hypokalemia 11/59 (18) Lower(Below median Cmin ss) 6.2 21/59 (36) Higher (Above median Cmin ss) 35.2 Peripheral edema 16/60 (27) Lower (Below median Cmin_ss) 6.2 9/60 (15) Higher (Above median Cmin_ss) 35.2 Hypertension 5/59 (8.5) 1.1.3 Is the proposed dose reduction appropriate for management of hepatotoxicity? No. The two-step dose reduction (1000 to 750 to 500 mg) which gives an option of treating a patient at 750 mg before further reducing the dose to 500 mg should be utilized to manage hepatotoxicity (defined as ALT or AST > 5 x ULN or Bilirubin > 3 x ULN). • Efficacy at lower doses or exposures (500 mg dose) is unknown. Reducing the exposures by could result in loss of efficacy. • Both 750 mg and 1000 mg doses had similar biomarker activity in study COU-AA-001 (phase 1/2 dose ranging study). A near maximal increase was observed in mean deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone (steroids upstream of CYP17 that serve as biomarkers of the completeness of CYP17 inhibition) levels at the 750 mg dose whereas higher doses of 1000 and 2000 mg did not raise the levels. At these doses, testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were below the lower limit of detection. Thus, having an option to be treated at 750 mg may reduce the likelihood of experiencing hepatotoxicity while maintaining efficacy. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 64 • The two-step dose reduction was specified in the protocol for study COU-AA-301 to manage hepatotoxicity and other toxicities. The majority of the patients (21/27) followed the step dose reduction scheme in the pivotal trial. Approximately 60% (16/27) of the patients had their dose reduced to 750 mg and did not need further dose reduction. Five patients had step dose reductions from 1000 to 750 to 500 mg. Thus, having an option to be treated at the 750 mg dose may reduce the likelihood of experiencing hepatotoxicity while maintaining efficacy ( Table 3). Table 3. Dose reductions in pivotal trial COU-AA-301 Abiraterone Acetate (N=791) Placebo (N= 394) Total Dose Reductions 27 (3.4%) 5 (1.3%) Maximum AA dose reduction 1000 to 750 mg 16 5† 1000 to 250 mg 0 - 1000 to 750 to 500 mg 5 - Due to Elevated ALS/AST 3 (0.4%) 0 † Since the actual amount of placebo dose was not reported, it was assumed that one dose reduction meant reduction from 1000-750 mg. 1.2 Recommendations Division of Pharmacometrics finds the NDA acceptable from a clinical pharmacology perspective and has the following recommendations for the applicant. • The applicant is encouraged to collect sparse pharmacokinetic data (at least for one cycle at steady state) from ALL subjects in their future trials. The purpose is to develop exposure response relationships for efficacy and safety endpoints to support proposed dosing recommendations. • The applicant should update their safety database with additional data from the future trials to justify their dose modification strategies using exposure-safety analysis. 1.3 Label Statements Please see section 3 of the clinical pharmacology review for detailed labeling recommendations. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) ( b ) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 65 2 Pertinent Regulatory Background Abiraterone acetate and its active metabolite abiraterone are selective steroidal inhibitors of 17α hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17), an enzyme that is used in the production of androgens in the testes and adrenal glands. Abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted to abiraterone after oral administration. The indication sought in the current application is for abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing a Before 2010, the only approved treatment known to improve survival in patients with mCRPC was docetaxel, a cytotoxic agent administered in combination with prednisone. Recently, cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone was approved in the United States (U.S.) for hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer following a docetaxel-containing regimen. Cabazitaxel and prednisone improved survival by median 2.4 months compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone (hazard ratio [HR]=0.70; p<0.0001). However, patients treated with cabazitaxel experience a high incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Thus, the applicant mentions that an unmet need exists for new therapies that prolong OS after chemotherapy without producing the side effects associated with cytotoxic agents and claims that the safety profile of abiraterone acetate across studies in mCRPC was distinct from the safety profile of cytotoxic therapies, which are associated with AEs such as myelosuppression (including febrile neutropenia) and stomatitis that can compromise quality of life during treatment of mCRPC. The applicant in the current NDA submission conducted two phase 1 dose ranging studies to come up with 1000 mg daily dosing regimen of AA for the pivotal trial. The pivotal trial was a phase 3 multinational, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisone in patients with mCRPC whose disease had progressed on or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. This study randomized 1195 patients 2:1 to receive 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate daily plus 5 mg of prednisone twice daily or placebo plus prednisone, respectively. In regions where prednisone was not available, prednisolone was provided. The primary efficacy endpoint was OS with a median OS of 14.8 months in the abiraterone acetate arm versus 10.9 months in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001) with a hazard ratio of 0.646. AEs of special interest included liver function abnormalities and mineralocorticoid-related toxicities such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema. 3 Results of Sponsor’s Analysis 3.1 Exposure-Response Analysis for Effectiveness The applicant conducted two types of exposure-response analysis for effectiveness: • Association of abiraterone exposures to prostate specific antigen (PSA) and then associating PSA dynamics to OS. • Direct relationship between exposures of abiraterone and OS. Reference ID: 2933046 (b) (4) NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 66 Because of the ambiguity regarding the appropriateness of PSA as a biomarker in prostate cancer patients, only direct exposure-response analysis relating abiraterone exposures to OS was reviewed and will be discussed. 3.1.1 Methods The patients with PK data were divided by median Cmin. Lower Cmin group included patients with Cmin ≤ 11.8 ng/mL (N=81), and higher Cmin group included patients with Cmin > 11.8 ng•hr/mL (N=80). A similar analysis was conducted using the population predicted steady state AUC. The patients with PK were divided by median AUC. The lower AUC group included patients with AUC ≤ 656 ng•hr/mL (N=81), and the higher AUC group included patients with AUC > 656 ng•hr/mL (N=80). 3.1.2 Conclusions No separation between the survival curves of lower and higher exposure groups were observed (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows that the survival curves of patients with and without PK overlapped indicating that patients with PK data are representation of the treatment group.

Nevertheless, the conclusions were similar for both approaches. • The applicant submitted two sets of survival data in the NDA submission. The first survival dataset was based on the January 2010, the cutoff date of the pre-specified interim analysis. The second updated survival dataset was submitted after 97% of the planned number of events for the final analysis took place (September 2010 cutoff). The exposure-response analysis was conducted using both the survival datasets. • The reviewer performed both univariate and multivariate regression using Cox proportional hazard analysis to explore if Cmin_ss was a predictor of OS.

The aim of the present analysis was to perform: • exposure-response analysis using observed Cmin_ss for both interim analysis dataset (January 2010 cutoff) and updated survival dataset (September 2010 cutoff). • univariate and multivariate (adjusting for confounding risk factors) Cox-proportional hazard analysis to explore if Cmin_ss was a predictor of OS. 4.1.2 Methods The primary efficacy assessment was OS defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Survival time of living subjects was to be censored at the last date a subject was known to be alive or lost to follow up. Data from only pivotal trial (COU-AA-301) were used for this analysis to focus only on efficacy in patients (CRPC patients) for which the indication is proposed. Pharmacokinetic data were available for 161/798 (20%) of the subjects. However, observed steady state trough concentrations were available for 119 (15%) patients, which was utilized for the exploratory exposure-response analysis for OS. Thus, the exposure-response dataset only consisted of these 119 patients, which is a major limitation of the analysis. Since observed Cmin_ss was available for only 119 patients, the data were divided into two groups by median Cmin_ss (11.1 ng/ml): Lower exposure group (Cmin_ss ≤ 11.1 ng/ml) and higher exposure group (Cmin_ss > 11.1 ng/ml). 4.1.3 Datasets The datasets utilized for the analysis are summarized below. Reference ID: 2933046 NDA 202-379 Review – Abiraterone Acetate 69 4.1.4 Software SAS 9.2 and TIBCO Spotfire S-Plus 8.1were used for analyses. 4.1.5 Model A Kaplan Meier analysis was performed for OS stratified by two exposure groups. Common risk factors (ECOG, baseline LDH, prior cytotoxic therapy (1 vs. 2), radio progression or PSA only progression) were compared between the two exposure groups. A cox-proportional hazard analysis was also conducted to test the significance of Cmin_ss as an independent predictor for survival, and also after adjusting for other risk factors. 4.1.6 Results The Table 4 below shows the mean and 90% CI of exposures in the lower and higher exposure groups. Table 4: Cmin_ss in the lower and higher exposure groups. Group N Mean Cmin_ss (5th, 95th percentile) Lower exposure (Cmin_ss ≤ 11.1 ng/ml) 60 6.2 (1.3, 10.7) Higher exposure (Cmin_ss > 11.1 ng /ml) 59 35.2 (12.5, 115.8) The exposure-efficacy analysis for updated OS data showed that higher exposure group had numerically higher median survival (Figure 4). This analysis was however confounded by other risk factors which were not balanced within the two exposure groups (Table 5). The lower exposure group had a larger proportion of patients who had ECOG=2 and also a slightly higher proportion of patients with two prior cytotoxic therapies. The mean baseline LDH level was also higher in lower exposure group.

It was concluded that the proposed dissolution method as shown below was acceptable. Apparatus: USP 2 (Paddle) at 50 rpm Medium: Phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) 900 mL containing 0.25% SLS, at 37ºC However, it was recommended that the dissolution specification be tightened as follows: Change from: Q= at 45 min to: Q= at 30 min On 03/15/11, an Agency’s letter was sent to the applicant requesting the above change. The applicant responded on 03/21/11 with additional stability-dissolution data and a new dissolution specification proposal of Q= at 30 min. On 03/29/11, a teleconference was held between the Agency and the applicant. After the T-con, the first Biopharmaceutics review addendum was completed on the same day and the Agency still recommended Q= at 30 min. This second Biopharmaceutics addendum is to address the applicant’s response submitted on 03/31/11 that the applicant agreed with the Agency’s proposed dissolution specification and updated the specifications table (under section M32P51). Therefore, this NDA is acceptable from the Biopharmaceutics perspective.

This enzyme is required for androgen biosynthesis and is expressed in testicular, adrenal and prostatic tumor tissues. CYP 17 catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into the testosterone precursors, DHEA, and androstenedione, respectively.

Abiraterone acetate is a new molecular entity (NME) which was developed previously under IND 71,023. Abiraterone acetate is reported as a BCS Class 4 drug. Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) is indicated for the use with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic (castration-resistant prostate cancer) in patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing a The recommended dose for the indication is 1 g (4 x 250 mg tablets) orally as a single daily dose that must not be taken with food. The proposed commercial, to-be-marketed (TBM) formulation was used to manufacture the registration stability and Phase III clinical trial material. The TBM tablet is to be debossed, whereas the clinically tested tablet is non-debossed. Comparative dissolution testing was requested and the sponsor submitted the dissolution data to address the debossing issue. The dissolution development report, dissolution data, and the proposed dissolution method using surfactant SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), and specifications were submitted. They are reviewed here. The proposed dissolution method and specification are summarized below. Apparatus: USP 2 (Paddle) at 50 rpm Medium: Phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) 900 mL containing 0.25% SLS, at 37ºC Specifications: Q= at 45 min The above dissolution method was reviewed and found acceptable.

Reference ID: 2915016 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) 3 BACKGROUND Abiraterone acetate was developed under IND 71,023. Abiraterone acetate is a pro-drug which is converted in vivo to abiraterone, a selective inhibitor of the enzyme 17a-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is required for androgen biosynthesis and is expressed in testicular, adrenal and prostatic tumor tissues. CYP 17 catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into the testosterone precursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively. Testosterone stimulates the development and progression of prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapies (GnRH analogues or orchiectomy) block the testicular source of testosterone and reduce testosterone concentrations to castrate levels but do not have an effect on the adrenal or peripheral sources, which continue to supply androgens to prostate tumor cells and promote disease progression. The sponsor reported that further reduction of testosterone concentrations below the castrate level by inhibition of CYP17 following administration of abiraterone acetate slows the progression of prostate cancer. CURRENT SUBMISSION On 12/20/10, the sponsor submitted NDA 202-379 under 505 (b)(1) for Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) seeking approval for the IR 250 mg tablets. Abiraterone acetate is an NME. Only one strength is proposed. So, there is no biowaiver issue. Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) is indicated for the use with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic (castration-resistant prostate cancer) in patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing a The recommended dose for the indication is 1 g (four 250 mg tablets) orally as a single daily dose that must not be taken with food. The proposed commercial TBM formulation was used to manufacture the registration stability and Phase III clinical trial material. The TBM formulation is to be debossed, however, the clinically tested formulation is non-debossed. The dissolution development report, dissolution data, and the proposed dissolution method and specifications were submitted. Additional information on the comparative dissolution was requested on 01/18/11 to address the difference in debossing issues and the sponsor responded on 01/27/11 and on 03/07/11. They are reviewed here. FORMULATION COMPARISONS Abiraterone acetate is reported as a BCS Class 4 drug. The TBM formulation (No. JNJ-212082-AAA-G-002) is shown below, which has been tested clinically.
