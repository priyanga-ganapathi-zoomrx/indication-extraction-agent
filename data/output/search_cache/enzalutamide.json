        "content": "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors; and consequently, inhibits nuclear translocation of androgen receptors and their interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N‑desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide.\nEnzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model.",

XTANDI can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Swallow capsules or tablets whole. Do not chew, dissolve, or open the capsules. Do not cut, crush, or chew the tablets [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].\n2.2 Dose Modifications If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, withhold dosing for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg), if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.2)].\nConcomitant Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce the XTANDI dose to 80 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nConcomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the XTANDI dose from 160 mg to 240 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n2.3 Important Administration Instructions Patients receiving XTANDI should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy.\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ® castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).\nXTANDI 40 mg capsules are white to off-white oblong soft gelatin capsules imprinted in black ink with ENZ.\nXTANDI 40 mg tablets are yellow, round, film-coated and debossed with E 40.\nXTANDI 80 mg tablets are yellow, oval, film-coated and debossed with E 80.\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Seizure Seizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials.\nIn these trials, patients with predisposing factors for seizure were generally excluded.\nSeizure occurred from 13 to 1776 days after initiation of XTANDI. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy, and all seizure events resolved.\nIn a single-arm trial designed to assess the risk of seizure in patients with pre-disposing factors for seizure, 8 of 366 (2.2%) XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure.\nThree of the 8 patients experienced a second seizure during continued treatment with XTANDI after their first seizure resolved. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following pre-disposing factors: the use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold (~ 54%), history of traumatic brain or head injury (~ 28%), history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (~ 24%), and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, past history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection (all < 5%). Approximately 17% of patients had more than one risk factor.\nAdvise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others.\nPermanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.\n5.2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving XTANDI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.\n5.3 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with enzalutamide in seven randomized clinical trials.\n(0.1%) have been observed with enzalutamide in seven randomized clinical trials.\nPharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.\n5.4 Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0.7% on the placebo arm. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0.1% on the placebo arm.\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.\n5.5 Falls and Fractures Falls and fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents.\nIn the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 fractures occurred in 3% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 2% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to onset of fracture was 336 days (range: 2 to 1914 days) for patients treated with XTANDI. Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone-targeted agents were not performed in the studies.\n5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: • • • • Seizure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Ischemic Heart Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe data in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect seven randomized, controlled trials [AFFIRM, PREVAIL, TERRAIN, PROSPER, ARCHES, Asian PREVAIL (NCT02294461), and STRIVE (NCT01664923)] that were pooled to conduct safety analyses in patients with CRPC (N=3509) or mCSPC (N= 572) treated with XTANDI. Patients received XTANDI 160 mg (N= 4081) or placebo orally once daily (N= 2472) or bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily (N= 387). All patients continued androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In these seven trials, the median duration of treatment was 13.8 months (range: <0.1 to 87.6) in the XTANDI group.\nIn four placebo-controlled trials (AFFIRM, PROSPER, PREVAIL, and ARCHES), the median duration of treatment was 14.3 months (range: <0.1 to 87.6) in the XTANDI group [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In these four trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension.\nAFFIRM (NCT00974311): XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy AFFIRM enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids.\nGrade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients.

Patients were randomized 2:1 and received either XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 930) or placebo (N = 465). The median duration of treatment at the time of analysis was 18.4 months (range: 0.0 to 42 months) with XTANDI and 11.1 months (range: 0.0 to 43 months) with placebo.\nOverall, 32 patients (3.4%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse events. The reasons for death with ≥ 2 patients included coronary artery disorders (n = 7), sudden death (n = 2), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 2), general physical health deterioration (n = 2), stroke (n = 2), and secondary malignancy (n = 5; one each of acute myeloid leukemia, brain neoplasm, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, and malignant neoplasm of unknown primary site). Three patients (0.6%) receiving placebo died from adverse events of cardiac arrest (n = 1), left ventricular failure (n = 1), and pancreatic carcinoma (n = 1).\nGrade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported among 31% of XTANDI-treated patients and 23% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations with an adverse event as the primary reason were reported for 9.4% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6.0% of placebo-treated patients. Of these, the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation was fatigue, which occurred in 1.6% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity (edema of the face, tongue, lip, or pharynx) Neurological Disorders: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Inhibit CYP2C8 Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased the composite area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold. Co‑administration of XTANDI with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If co-administration of XTANDI with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of XTANDI [see Dosage and Neutrophil count decreased White blood cell decreased Hyperglycemia Hypermagnesemia Hyponatremia Hypercalcemia Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 Co-administration of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 37%.\nCo-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) with XTANDI should be avoided if possible. St John’s wort may decrease enzalutamide exposure and should be avoided. If co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with XTANDI cannot be avoided, increase the dose of XTANDI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.3 Effect of XTANDI on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer in humans. At steady-state, XTANDI reduced the plasma exposure to midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate). Concomitant use of XTANDI with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) and CYP2C19 (e.g., S-mephenytoin, clopidogrel) should be avoided, as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure. If co-administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, conduct additional INR monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy. There are no human data on the use of XTANDI in pregnant females.\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral administration of enzalutamide in pregnant mice during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (see Data).\nData Animal Data In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in mice, enzalutamide caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-15). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post-implantation loss and resorptions) and decreased anogenital distance at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day, and cleft palate and absent palatine bone at 30 mg/kg/day. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day caused maternal toxicity. The doses tested in mice (1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.04, 0.4 and 1.1 times, respectively, the exposures in patients. Enzalutamide did not cause developmental toxicity in rabbits when administered throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-18) at dose levels up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 times the exposures in patients based on AUC).\nIn a pharmacokinetic study in pregnant rats with a single oral 30 mg/kg enzalutamide administration on gestation day 14, enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present in the fetus at a C that was approximately 0.3 times the concentration found in maternal plasma and occurred 4 hours after administration.\n8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. There is no information available on the presence of XTANDI in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present in milk of lactating rats (see Data).\nData Following a single oral administration in lactating rats on postnatal day 14, enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present in milk at a C that was 4 times higher than concentrations in the plasma and occurred 4 hours after administration.\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males Based on findings in animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\nInfertility Males Based on animal studies, XTANDI may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].\n8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of XTANDI in pediatric patients have not been established.\n8.5 Geriatric Use Of 4081 patients who received XTANDI in seven randomized, controlled clinical trials, 78% were 65 and over, while 35% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment A dedicated renal impairment trial for XTANDI has not been conducted. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with metastatic CRPC and healthy volunteers, no significant difference in enzalutamide clearance was observed in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate renal impairment max max (30 mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≤ 89 mL/min) compared to patients and volunteers with baseline normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease have not been assessed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Dedicated hepatic impairment trials compared the composite systemic exposure of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide in volunteers with baseline mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C, respectively) versus healthy controls with normal hepatic function. The composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in volunteers with mild, moderate, or severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to volunteers with normal hepatic function. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose, stop treatment with XTANDI and initiate general supportive measures taking into consideration the half-life of 5.8 days. In a dose escalation study, no seizures were reported at < 240 mg daily, whereas 3 seizures were reported, 1 each at 360 mg, 480 mg, and 600 mg daily. Patients may be at increased risk of seizure following an overdose.\n11 DESCRIPTION Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor. The chemical name is 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro-N-methylbenzamide.\nThe molecular weight is 464.44 and molecular formula is C H F N O S. The structural formula is: Enzalutamide is a white crystalline non-hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water.\nXTANDI is available as liquid-filled soft gelatin capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 40 mg of enzalutamide as a solution in caprylocaproyl 21 16 4 4 2 polyoxylglycerides. The inactive ingredients are caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, gelatin, sorbitol sorbitan solution, glycerin, purified water, titanium dioxide, and black iron oxide.\nXTANDI is also available as film-coated tablets for oral administration. Each tablet contains 40 mg or 80 mg of enzalutamide. The inactive ingredients are hypromellose acetate succinate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The tablet film-coat contains hypromellose, talc, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors; and consequently, inhibits nuclear translocation of androgen receptors and their interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N‑desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide.\nEnzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of enzalutamide 160 mg/day at steady-state on the QTc interval was evaluated in 796 patients with metastatic CRPC. No large difference (i.e., greater than 20 ms) was observed between the mean QT interval change from baseline in patients treated with XTANDI and that in patients treated with placebo, based on the Fridericia correction method. However, small increases in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) due to enzalutamide cannot be excluded due to limitations of the study design.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and its major active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide) were evaluated in patients with metastatic CRPC and healthy male volunteers. The plasma enzalutamide pharmacokinetics are adequately described by a linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption.\nAbsorption Following oral administration of XTANDI capsules (160 mg daily) in patients with metastatic CRPC, the median time to reach maximum plasma enzalutamide concentrations (C ) is 1 hour (range 0.5 to 3 hours). At steady-state, the plasma mean C values for enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are 16.6 μg/mL (23% CV) and 12.7 μg/mL (30% CV), respectively, and the plasma mean predose trough values are 11.4 μg/mL (26% CV) and 13.0 μg/mL (30% CV), respectively. Following a single dose administration of 160 mg enzalutamide in healthy male volunteers, enzalutamide extent of absorption (AUC) was comparable between XTANDI tablet and XTANDI capsule, but the mean C was 10%-28% lower than that of XTANDI capsules.\nThe steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles (AUC and C ) of enzalutamide and N-max max max max desmethyl enzalutamide are similar for XTANDI tablet and XTANDI capsule.\nWith the daily dosing regimen, enzalutamide steady-state is achieved by Day 28, and enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily fluctuations in enzalutamide plasma concentrations are low (mean peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). At steady-state, enzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of 30 to 360 mg.\nA single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered to healthy volunteers with a high-fat meal or in the fasted condition. A high-fat meal did not alter the AUC to enzalutamide or N-desmethyl enzalutamide. The results are summarized in Figure 1.\nDistribution and Protein Binding The mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 110 L (29% CV).\nEnzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. N-desmethyl enzalutamide is 95% bound to plasma proteins. In vitro, there was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and other highly protein bound drugs (warfarin, ibuprofen, and salicylic acid) at clinically relevant concentrations.\nMetabolism Following single oral administration of C-enzalutamide 160 mg, plasma samples were analyzed for enzalutamide and its metabolites up to 77 days post dose. Enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and a major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite accounted for 88% of the C-radioactivity in plasma, representing 30%, 49%, and 10%, respectively, of the total C-AUC .\nIn vitro, human CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide. Based on in vivo and in vitro data, CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide). In vitro data suggest that carboxylesterase 1 metabolizes N-desmethyl enzalutamide and enzalutamide to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite.\nIn vitro, N-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate of human CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5.\nElimination Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism. Following single oral administration of C-enzalutamide 160 mg, 85% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71% is recovered in urine (including only trace amounts of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide), and 14% is recovered in feces (0.4% of dose as unchanged enzalutamide and 1% as N-desmethyl enzalutamide).\nThe mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 0.56 L/h (range 0.33 to 1.02 L/h).\nThe mean terminal half-life (t ) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days). Following a single 160 mg oral dose of enzalutamide in healthy volunteers, the mean terminal t for N-desmethyl enzalutamide is approximately 7.8 to 8.6 days.\nPharmacokinetics in Special Populations max 14 14 14 0-inf 14 1/2 1/2 Renal Impairment: A population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on pre-existing renal function) was carried out with data from 59 healthy male volunteers and 926 patients with metastatic CRPC enrolled in clinical trials, including 512 with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min), 332 with mild renal impairment (CrCL 60 to < 90 mL/min), 88 with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 60 mL/min), and 1 with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min). The apparent clearance of enzalutamide was similar in patients with pre-existing mild and moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 90 mL/min) compared to patients and volunteers with normal renal function. The potential effect of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics cannot be determined as clinical and pharmacokinetic data are available from only one patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].\nHepatic Impairment: The plasma pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide were examined in volunteers with normal hepatic function (N = 22) and with pre-existing mild (N = 8, Child-Pugh Class A) moderate (N = 8, Child-Pugh Class B), or severe (N = 8, Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. XTANDI was administered as a single 160 mg dose. The composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in volunteers with mild, moderate, or severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to volunteers with normal hepatic function. The results are summarized in Figure 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\nBody Weight and Age: Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that weight (range: 46 to 163 kg) and age (range: 41 to 92 yr) do not have a clinically meaningful influence on the exposure to enzalutamide.\nGender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide has not been evaluated.\nRace: The majority of XTANDI-treated patients in the randomized clinical trials were Caucasian (81%). Based on pharmacokinetic data from studies in Japanese and Chinese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant differences in exposure among the populations. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races.\nDrug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI: In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor). Gemfibrozil increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold with minimal effect on C . The results are summarized in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].\nIn a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer). Rifampin decreased the AUC of enzalutamide plus 0‑inf max 0‑inf N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 37% with no effect on C . The results are summarized in Figure 1[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nIn a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Itraconazole increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3-fold with no effect on C . The results are summarized in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Effects of Other Drugs and Intrinsic/Extrinsic Factors on XTANDI PK parameters (C and AUC ) are for enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide, except in the food-effect trial, where they are for enzalutamide alone. * See Dosage and Administration (2.2).\nEffect of XTANDI on Other Drugs: In an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug-drug interaction trial in patients with metastatic CRPC, a single oral dose of the CYP probe substrate cocktail (for CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) was administered before and concomitantly with XTANDI (following at least 55 days of dosing at 160 mg daily). The results are summarized in Figure 2. Results showed that in vivo, at steady-state, XTANDI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].\nXTANDI did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate.\nIn an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug-drug interaction trial in patients with CRPC, a single oral dose of the CYP probe substrate cocktail for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 was administered before and concomitantly with XTANDI (following at least 49 days of dosing at 160 mg daily). The results are summarized in Figure 2. Results showed that in vivo, at steady-0‑inf max 0‑inf max # max 0-inf state, XTANDI did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to the CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates.\nFigure 2. Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs *See Drug Interactions (7.3). In vitro, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite caused direct inhibition of multiple CYP enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5; however, subsequent clinical data showed that XTANDI is an inducer of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 and had no clinically meaningful effect on CYP2C8 (see Figure 2). In vitro, enzalutamide caused time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2.\nIn vitro studies showed that enzalutamide induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and does not induce CYP1A2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations.\nIn vitro, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite are not substrates for human P-glycoprotein. In vitro, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inhibitors of human P-glycoprotein, while the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite is not.\nIn vitro, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide do not appear to be substrates of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP); however, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inhibitors of human BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations.\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at oral enzalutamide doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day. Enzalutamide increased the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors in the testes at all dose levels tested (≥ 0.3 times the human exposure based on AUC) and combined incidence of urothelial papilloma and carcinoma in the urinary bladder in male rats at 100 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the human exposure based on AUC). The findings in the testes are considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide. Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes. Administration of enzalutamide to male and female rasH2 transgenic mice by oral gavage daily for 26 weeks did not result in increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.\nEnzalutamide did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not genotoxic in either the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (Tk) gene mutation assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\nBased on nonclinical findings in repeat-dose toxicology studies, which were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with XTANDI. In a 26-week study in rats, atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles was observed at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (equal to the human exposure based on AUC). In 4-, 13-, and 39-week studies in dogs, hypospermatogenesis and atrophy of the prostate and epididymides were observed at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the human exposure based on AUC).\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of XTANDI in patients with CRPC (N = 4692) or mCSPC (N = 1150) was demonstrated in five randomized, multicenter clinical trials. All patients received concomitant GnRH therapy or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were allowed, but not required, to continue or initiate glucocorticoids.\nAFFIRM (NCT00974311): XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy In AFFIRM, a total of 1199 patients who had received prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 800) or placebo orally once daily (N = 399). Study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-related event, or clinical progression), initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Patients with a previous history of seizure, taking medicines known to decrease the seizure threshold, or with other risk factors for seizure were not eligible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 41-92) and the racial distribution was 92.7% Caucasian, 3.9% Black, 1.1% Asian, and 2.1% Other. Ninety-two percent of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0-1 and 28% had a mean Brief Pain Inventory score of ≥ 4. Ninety-one percent of patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral involvement in the lung and/or liver. Fifty-nine percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 41% had PSA-only progression on study entry. All patients had received prior docetaxel-based therapy and 24% had received two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids.\nA statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre-specified interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (Table 7 and Figure 3).\nTable 7.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in AFFIRM PREVAIL (NCT01212991): XTANDI versus Placebo in Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic CRPC In PREVAIL, 1717 chemotherapy-naïve patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 872) or placebo orally once daily (N = 845). Patients with visceral metastases, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA class I or II), and patients taking medications associated with lowering the seizure threshold were allowed. Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. Study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-related event, or clinical progression) and the initiation of a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were assessed. Radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria) and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. The primary analysis of rPFS utilized centrally reviewed radiographic assessment of progression.\nPatient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms at entry. The median age was 71 years (range 42-93) and the racial distribution was 77% Caucasian, 10% Asian, 2% Black and 11% Other. The ECOG performance status score was 0 for 68% of patients, and 1 for 32% of patients.\nBaseline pain assessment was 0-1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients, and 2-3 (mildly symptomatic) in 32% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry). Fifty-four percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 43% had PSA-only progression.\nTwelve percent of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) disease involvement. During the study, 27% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 30% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids for varying reasons.\nA statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre-specified interim analysis, conducted after 540 deaths in patients treated with XTANDI compared to those treated with placebo (Table 8). Forty percent of XTANDI-treated and 70% of placebo-treated patients received subsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that may prolong overall survival. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. The median follow-up time was 31 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre-specified interim analysis (Table 8, Figure 4). At the updated analysis, 52% of XTANDI-treated and 81% of placebo-treated patients had received subsequent therapies that may prolong overall survival in metastatic CRPC. XTANDI was used as a subsequent therapy in 2% of XTANDI-treated patients and 29% of placebo-treated patients.\nTable 8.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Radiographic Progression-free Survival in PREVAIL Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was prolonged after XTANDI treatment, with a median of 28.0 months for patients on the XTANDI arm versus a median of 10.8 months for patients on the placebo arm [HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.40), p < 0.0001].\nThe median time to first skeletal‑related event was 31.1 months for patients on the XTANDI arm versus 31.3 months for patients on the placebo arm [HR = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.84), p < 0.0001]. A skeletal‑related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone for prostate cancer, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain.\nTERRAIN (NCT01288911): XTANDI versus Bicalutamide in Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic CRPC TERRAIN was conducted in 375 chemotherapy-naïve patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 184) or bicalutamide orally at a dose of 50 mg once daily (N = 191). Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to seizure and patients with moderate to severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. Patients could have received prior bicalutamide, but those whose disease had progressed on prior antiandrogen therapy (e.g., bicalutamide) were excluded. Study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-related event), the initiation of subsequent antineoplastic agent, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Radiographic disease progression was assessed by Independent Central Review (ICR) using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions.\nRadiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic progression as assessed by ICR or death, whichever occurred first.\nPatient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms at entry. The median age was 71 years (range 48-96) and the racial distribution was 93% Caucasian, 5% Black, 1% Asian and 1% Other. The ECOG performance status score was 0 for 74% of patients and 1 for 26% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0‑1 (asymptomatic) in 58% of patients, and 2‑3 (mildly symptomatic) in 36% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Question 3 (worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry). Ninety-eight percent of patients had objective evidence of disease progression at study entry. Forty-six percent of patients had received prior treatment with bicalutamide while no patients received prior treatment with XTANDI.\nAn improvement in rPFS was demonstrated in patients treated with XTANDI compared to patients treated with bicalutamide (Table 10, Figure 6).\nTable 10.

Hazard Ratio < 1 favors XTANDI * PROSPER (NCT02003924): XTANDI versus Placebo in Non-metastatic CRPC PROSPER enrolled 1401 patients with non-metastatic CRPC who were randomized 2:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 933) or placebo orally once daily (N = 468). All patients in the PROSPER trial received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had a prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were stratified by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Doubling Time (PSADT) and the use of bone-targeting agents. Patients were required to have a PSA doubling time ≤ 10 months, PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL, and confirmation of non-metastatic disease by blinded independent central review (BICR). PSA results were blinded and were not used for treatment discontinuation. Patients randomized to either arm discontinued treatment for radiographic disease progression confirmed by BICR, initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.\nThe following patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The median age at randomization was 74 years (range 50-95) and 23% were 80 years of age or older. The racial distribution was 71% Caucasian, 16% Asian, and 2% Black. A majority of patients had a Gleason score of 7 or higher (77%).\nThe median PSADT was 3.7 months. Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients received prior treatment for prostate cancer with either surgery or radiation. Sixty-three percent (63%) of patients received prior treatment with an anti-androgen; 56% of patients received bicalutamide and 11% of patients received flutamide. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score of 0 or 1 at study entry.\nThe major efficacy outcome of the study was metastasis-free survival (MFS), defined as the time from randomization to whichever of the following occurred first 1) loco-regional and/or distant radiographic progression per BICR or 2) death up to 112 days after treatment discontinuation without evidence of radiographic progression. A statistically significant improvement in MFS and OS was demonstrated in patients randomized to receive XTANDI compared with patients randomized to receive placebo. Consistent MFS results were observed when considering only distant radiographic progression events or deaths regardless of the cut-off date. Consistent MFS results were also observed in pre-specified and stratified patient sub-groups of PSADT (< 6 months or ≥ 6 months) and use of a prior bone-targeting agent (yes or no). The efficacy results from PROSPER are summarized in Table 11, Figure 7 and Figure 8.\nTable 11.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in PROSPER The primary efficacy outcome was also supported by a statistically significant delay in time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy (TTA) for patients in the XTANDI arm compared to those in the placebo arm. The median TTA was 39.6 months for patients on XTANDI and was 17.7 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.21; 95% CI: [0.17, 0.26], p < 0.0001).\nARCHES (NCT02677896): XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CSPC ARCHES enrolled 1150 patients with mCSPC who were randomized 1:1 to receive XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N=574) or placebo orally once daily (N=576). All patients in the trial received a GnRH analog or had a prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were stratified by volume of disease (low vs high) and prior docetaxel therapy for prostate cancer (no prior docetaxel, 1-5 cycles, or 6 prior cycles).\nHigh volume of disease is defined as metastases involving the viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, there must be 4 or more bone lesions, at least 1 of which must be in a bony structure beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone. Treatment with concurrent docetaxel was not allowed. Patients continued treatment until radiographic disease progression, initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.\nThe following patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The median age at randomization was 70 years (range: 42-92) and 30% were 75 years of age or older. The racial distribution was 81% Caucasian, 14% Asian, and 1% Black. Sixty-six percent (66%) of patients had a Gleason score of ≥ 8.\nThirty-seven percent (37%) of patients had a low volume of disease and 63% of patients had a high volume of disease. Eighty-two percent (82%) of patients had no prior docetaxel treatment; 2% of patients had 1 to 5 cycles of docetaxel and 16% of patients had 6 prior cycles of docetaxel treatment. Twelve percent (12%) of patients received concomitant bone-targeted agents (bisphosphonates or RANKL inhibitors) which included both prostate and non-prostate cancer indications. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score was 0 for 78% of patients and 1 for 22% of patients at study entry.\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) based on blinded independent central review (BICR). Radiographic progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to radiographic disease progression at any time or death within 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation.\nRadiographic disease progression was defined by identification of 2 or more new bone lesions on a bone scan with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria) and/or progression in soft tissue disease. Time to new antineoplastic therapy was an additional efficacy endpoint.\nXTANDI demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in rPFS compared to placebo. Consistent rPFS results were observed in patients with high or low volume of disease and patients with and without prior docetaxel therapy. Overall survival (OS) data were not mature at the time of rPFS analysis (7.3% deaths in the ITT population had been reported). Efficacy results for rPFS from ARCHES are summarized in Table 12 and Figure 9.\nTable 12.

Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors and inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of enzalutamide 160 mg/day at steady [...] Seizure 5.2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Inhibit CYP2C8 7.2 Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 7.3 Effect of XTANDI on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy 8.3 Nursing Mothers 8.4 Pediatric Use 8.5 Geriatric Use 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment 10 OVERDOSAGE 11 DESCRIPTION 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action 12.2 Pharmacodynamics 12.3 Pharmacokinetics 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Sections or subsections omitted from the Full [...] please visit  11 DESCRIPTION Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor.

(2.2, 7.2)  Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring. (7.3) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XTANDI® is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of XTANDI is 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules) administered orally once daily. XTANDI can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Swallow capsules whole. Do not chew, dissolve, or open the capsules. 2.2 Dose Modifications If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, withhold dosing for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg), if warranted. Concomitant Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce the XTANDI dose to 80 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the XTANDI dose from 160 mg to 240 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS XTANDI 40 mg capsules are white to off-white oblong soft gelatin capsules imprinted in black ink with ENZ. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy XTANDI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. XTANDI is not indicated for use in women. XTANDI is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for pregnancy loss [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Seizure In Study 1, which enrolled patients who previously received docetaxel, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with XTANDI experienced a seizure and no patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. Seizure occurred from 31 to 603 days after initiation of XTANDI. In Study 2, 1 of 871 (0.1%) chemotherapy-naive patients treated with XTANDI and 1 of 844 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy and all seizure events resolved. There is no clinical trial experience re-administering XTANDI to patients who experienced seizure. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Limited safety data are available in patients with predisposing factors for seizure because these patients were generally excluded from the trials. These exclusion criteria included a history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past 12 months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, and brain arteriovenous malformation. Study 1 excluded the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold, whereas Study 2 permitted the use of these medications. Because of the risk of seizure associated with XTANDI use, patients should be advised of the risk of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. 5.2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving XTANDI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:  Seizure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two randomized clinical trials enrolled patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed on androgen deprivation therapy (GnRH therapy or bilateral orchiectomy), a disease setting that is also defined as metastatic CRPC. In both studies, patients received XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily in the active treatment arm or placebo in the control arm. All patients continued androgen deprivation therapy. Patients were allowed, but not required, to take glucocorticoids. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that occurred more commonly (≥ 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients from the two randomized clinical trials were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, diarrhea, hot flush, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral edema, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, weight decreased, headache, hypertension, and dizziness/vertigo. Study 1: Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Following Chemotherapy Study 1 enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids. Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients and 53% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients and 18% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients. Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported in Study 1 that occurred at a ≥ 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm compared to the placebo arm.

Study 2: Chemotherapy-naive Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Study 2 enrolled 1717 patients with metastatic CRPC who had not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, of whom 1715 received at least one dose of study drug. The median duration of treatment was 17.5 months with XTANDI and 4.6 months with placebo. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were reported in 44% of XTANDI-treated patients and 37% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 6% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was fatigue/asthenia, which occurred in 1% of patients on each treatment arm.

Laboratory Abnormalities In the two randomized clinical trials, Grade 1-4 neutropenia occurred in 15% of patients treated with XTANDI (1% Grade 3-4) and in 6% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% Grade 3-4). The incidence of Grade 1-4 thrombocytopenia was 6% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.3% Grade 3-4) and 5% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% Grade 3-4). Grade 1-4 elevations in ALT occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.2% Grade 3-4) and 16% of patients treated with placebo (0.2% Grade 3-4). Grade 1-4 elevations in bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.1% Grade 3-4) and 2% of patients treated with placebo (no Grade 3-4). Infections In Study 1, 1% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo died from infections or sepsis. In Study 2, 1 patient in each treatment group (0.1%) had an infection resulting in death. Falls and Fall-related Injuries In the two randomized clinical trials, falls including fall-related injuries, occurred in 9% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. Fall-related injuries were more severe in patients treated with XTANDI and included non-pathologic fractures, joint injuries, and hematomas. Hypertension In the two randomized trials, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients receiving XTANDI and 4% of patients receiving placebo. No patients experienced hypertensive crisis. Medical history of hypertension was balanced between arms. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in < 1% of patients in each arm. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of XTANDI. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Neurological Disorders: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Inhibit CYP2C8 Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased the composite area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold. Co-administration of XTANDI with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If co-administration of XTANDI with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of XTANDI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 Co-administration of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 37%. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) with XTANDI should be avoided if possible. St John’s wort may decrease enzalutamide exposure and should be avoided. If co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with XTANDI cannot be avoided, increase the dose of XTANDI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Effect of XTANDI on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer in humans. At steady state, XTANDI reduced the plasma exposure to midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate). Concomitant use of XTANDI with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) and CYP2C19 (e.g., S-mephenytoin) should be avoided, as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure. If co-administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, conduct additional INR monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X [see Contraindications (4)]. Risk Summary XTANDI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. While there are no human data on the use of XTANDI in pregnancy and XTANDI is not indicated for use in women, it is important to know that maternal use of an androgen receptor inhibitor could affect development of the fetus. Enzalutamide caused embryo-fetal toxicity in mice at exposures that were lower than in patients receiving the recommended dose. XTANDI is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant while receiving the drug. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for pregnancy loss. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with XTANDI. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Animal Data In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in mice, enzalutamide caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-15). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post-implantation loss and resorptions) and decreased anogenital distance at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day, and cleft palate and absent palatine bone at 30 mg/kg/day. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day caused maternal toxicity. The doses tested in mice (1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.04, 0.4 and 1.1 times, respectively, the exposures in patients. Enzalutamide did not cause developmental toxicity in rabbits when administered throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-18) at dose levels up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 times the exposures in patients based on AUC). 8.3 Nursing Mothers XTANDI is not indicated for use in women. It is not known if enzalutamide is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from XTANDI, a decision should be made to either discontinue nursing, or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of XTANDI in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 1671 patients who received XTANDI in the two randomized clinical trials, 75% were 65 and over, while 31% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment A dedicated renal impairment trial for XTANDI has not been conducted. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with metastatic CRPC and healthy volunteers, no significant difference in enzalutamide clearance was observed in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] ≤ 89 mL/min) compared to patients and volunteers with baseline normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min). No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease have not been assessed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Dedicated hepatic impairment trials compared the composite systemic exposure of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide in volunteers with baseline mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C, respectively) versus healthy controls with normal hepatic function. The composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N­ desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in volunteers with mild, moderate, or severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to volunteers with normal hepatic function. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose, stop treatment with XTANDI and initiate general supportive measures taking into consideration the half-life of 5.8 days. In a dose escalation study, no seizures were reported at < 240 mg daily, whereas 3 seizures were reported, 1 each at 360 mg, 480 mg, and 600 mg daily. Patients may be at increased risk of seizure following an overdose. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 11 DESCRIPTION Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor. The chemical name is 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5­ dimethyl-4-oxo-2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro-N-methylbenzamide. The molecular weight is 464.44 and molecular formula is C21H16F4N4O2S. The structural formula is: N N S O CF3 NHMe O F NC Enzalutamide is a white crystalline non-hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water. XTANDI is provided as liquid-filled soft gelatin capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 40 mg of enzalutamide as a solution in caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides. The inactive ingredients are caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, gelatin, sorbitol sorbitan solution, glycerin, purified water, titanium dioxide, and black iron oxide. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors and inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of enzalutamide 160 mg/day at steady state on the QTc interval was evaluated in 796 patients with metastatic CRPC. No large difference (i.e., greater than 20 ms) was observed between the mean QT interval change from baseline in patients treated with XTANDI and that in patients treated with placebo, based on the Fridericia correction method. However, small increases in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) due to enzalutamide cannot be excluded due to limitations of the study design. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and its major active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide) were evaluated in patients with metastatic CRPC and healthy male volunteers. The plasma enzalutamide pharmacokinetics are adequately described by a linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption. Absorption Following oral administration (XTANDI 160 mg daily) in patients with metastatic CRPC, the median time to reach maximum plasma enzalutamide concentrations (Cmax) is 1 hour (range 0.5 to 3 hours). At steady state, the plasma mean Cmax values for enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are 16.6 μg/mL (23% CV) and 12.7 μg/mL (30% CV), respectively, and the plasma mean predose trough values are 11.4 μg/mL (26% CV) and 13.0 μg/mL (30% CV), respectively. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda With the daily dosing regimen, enzalutamide steady state is achieved by Day 28, and enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily fluctuations in enzalutamide plasma concentrations are low (mean peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). At steady state, enzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of 30 to 360 mg. A single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered to healthy volunteers with a high-fat meal or in the fasted condition. A high-fat meal did not alter the AUC to enzalutamide or N-desmethyl enzalutamide. The results are summarized in Figure 1. Distribution and Protein Binding The mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 110 L (29% CV). Enzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. N-desmethyl enzalutamide is 95% bound to plasma proteins. In vitro, there was no protein binding displacement between enzalutamide and other highly protein bound drugs (warfarin, ibuprofen, and salicylic acid) at clinically relevant concentrations. Metabolism Following single oral administration of 14C-enzalutamide 160 mg, plasma samples were analyzed for enzalutamide and its metabolites up to 77 days post dose. Enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and a major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite accounted for 88% of the 14C-radioactivity in plasma, representing 30%, 49%, and 10%, respectively, of the total 14C-AUC0-inf. In vitro, human CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide. Based on in vivo and in vitro data, CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide). In vitro, N-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a substrate of human CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5. Elimination Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism. Following single oral administration of 14C-enzalutamide 160 mg, 85% of the radioactivity is recovered by 77 days post dose: 71% is recovered in urine (including only trace amounts of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide), and 14% is recovered in feces (0.4% of dose as unchanged enzalutamide and 1% as N-desmethyl enzalutamide). The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 0.56 L/h (range 0.33 to 1.02 L/h). The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days). Following a single 160 mg oral dose of enzalutamide in healthy volunteers, the mean terminal t1/2 for N­ desmethyl enzalutamide is approximately 7.8 to 8.6 days. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Renal Impairment: A population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on pre-existing renal function) was carried out with data from 59 healthy male volunteers and 926 patients with metastatic CRPC enrolled in clinical trials, including 512 with normal renal function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min), 332 with mild renal impairment (CrCL 60 to < 90 mL/min), 88 with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 60 mL/min), and 1 with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min). The apparent clearance of enzalutamide was similar in patients with pre-existing mild and moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30 to < 90 mL/min) compared to patients and volunteers with normal renal function. The potential effect of severe renal Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda impairment or end stage renal disease on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics cannot be determined as clinical and pharmacokinetic data are available from only one patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Hepatic Impairment: The plasma pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide were examined in volunteers with normal hepatic function (N = 22) and with pre-existing mild (N = 8, Child-Pugh Class A) moderate (N = 8, Child- Pugh B), or severe (N = 8, Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. XTANDI was administered as a single 160 mg dose. The composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in volunteers with mild, moderate, or severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to volunteers with normal hepatic function. The results are summarized in Figure 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Body Weight and Age: Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that weight (range: 46 to 163 kg) and age (range: 41 to 92 yr) do not have a clinically meaningful influence on the exposure to enzalutamide. Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide has not been evaluated. Race: The majority of XTANDI-treated patients in the randomized clinical trials were Caucasian (85%). Based on pharmacokinetic data from a study in Japanese patients with prostate cancer, there were no clinically relevant differences in exposure between Japanese and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in other races. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI: In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor). Gemfibrozil increased the AUC0-inf of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold with minimal effect on Cmax. The results are summarized in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer). Rifampin decreased the AUC0-inf of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 37% with no effect on Cmax. The results are summarized in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of XTANDI was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Itraconazole increased the AUC0-inf of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3-fold with no effect on Cmax. The results are summarized in Figure 1.

Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs: In an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug-drug interaction trial in patients with metastatic CRPC, a single oral dose of the CYP probe substrate cocktail (for CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) was administered before and concomitantly with XTANDI (following at least 55 days of dosing at 160 mg daily). The results are summarized in Figure 2. Results showed that in vivo, at steady state, XTANDI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. XTANDI did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate. In an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug-drug interaction trial in patients with CRPC, a single oral dose of the CYP probe substrate cocktail for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 was administered before and concomitantly with XTANDI (following at least 49 days of dosing at 160 mg daily). The results are summarized in Figure 2. Results showed that in vivo, at steady state, XTANDI did not cause clinically meaningful changes in exposure to the CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates. Figure 2. Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs *See Drug Interactions (7.3). In vitro, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite caused direct inhibition of multiple CYP enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5; however, subsequent clinical data showed that XTANDI is an inducer of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 and had no clinically meaningful effect on CYP2C8 (see Figure 2). In vitro, enzalutamide caused time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2. In vitro studies showed that enzalutamide induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and does not induce CYP1A2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda In vitro, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite are not substrates for human P-glycoprotein. In vitro, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inhibitors of human P­ glycoprotein, while the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite is not. In vitro, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide do not appear to be substrates of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP); however, enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inhibitors of human BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of enzalutamide. Enzalutamide did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not genotoxic in either the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (Tk) gene mutation assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on nonclinical findings in repeat-dose toxicology studies, which were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with XTANDI. In a 26-week study in rats, atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles was observed at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (equal to the human exposure based on AUC). In 4-, 13-, and 39-week studies in dogs, hypospermatogenesis and atrophy of the prostate and epididymides were observed at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the human exposure based on AUC). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of XTANDI in patients with metastatic CRPC were demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical trials. All patients continued on GnRH therapy or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were allowed, but not required, to continue or initiate glucocorticoids. Study 1: Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Following Chemotherapy A total of 1199 patients who had received prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N=800) or placebo orally once daily (N=399). Study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-related event, or clinical progression), initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Patients with a previous history of seizure, taking medicines known to decrease the seizure threshold, or with other risk factors for seizure were not eligible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 41-92) and the racial distribution was 92.7% Caucasian, 3.9% Black, 1.1% Asian, and 2.1% Other. Ninety-two percent of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0-1 and 28% had a mean Brief Pain Inventory score of ≥ 4. Ninety-one percent of patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral involvement in the lung and/or liver. Fifty-nine percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 41% had PSA-only progression on study entry. All patients had received prior docetaxel-based therapy and 24% had received two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids. A statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre-specified interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (Table 3 and Figure 3).

Patients with visceral metastases, patients with a history of mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA class I or II), and patients taking medications associated with lowering the seizure threshold were allowed. Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. Study treatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal-related event, or clinical Reference ID: 3828662 This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda progression) and the initiation of a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were assessed. Radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria) and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. The primary analysis of rPFS utilized centrally reviewed radiographic assessment of progression. Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms at entry. The median age was 71 years (range 42-93) and the racial distribution was 77% Caucasian, 10% Asian, 2% Black and 11% Other. The ECOG performance status score was 0 for 68% of patients, and 1 for 32% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0-1 (asymptomatic) in 67% of patients, and 2-3 (mildly symptomatic) in 32% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry). Fifty-four percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 43% had PSA-only progression. Twelve percent of patients had visceral (lung and/or liver) disease involvement. During the study, 27% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 30% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids for varying reasons. A statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre-specified interim analysis, conducted after 540 deaths in patients treated with XTANDI compared to those treated with placebo (Table 4). Forty percent of XTANDI-treated and 70% of placebo-treated patients received subsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that may prolong overall survival. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. The median follow-up time was 31 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre-specified interim analysis (Table 4, Figure 4). At the updated analysis, 52% of XTANDI-treated and 81% of placebo-treated patients had received subsequent therapies that may prolong overall survival in metastatic CRPC. XTANDI was used as a subsequent therapy in 2% of XTANDI-treated patients and 29% of placebo-treated patients. Table 4.

For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION \n\n# 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE \n\nXTANDI ® is indicated for the treatment of patients wi th: \n\n• castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) \n\n• metastatic castration -sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) \n\n• non -metastatic castration -sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high risk for \n\nmetastasis (high -risk BCR) \n\n# 2 DOSAGE AND ADMIN ISTRATION \n\n2.1 Recommended Dosage \n\nThe recommended dosage of XTANDI is 160 mg administered orally once daily with or without food [see  Clinical \n\nPharmacology  (12.3 )] until disease pr ogression or unacceptable toxicity . Swallow capsules or tablets whole. Do not chew, \n\ndissolve, or open the capsules. Do not cut, crush, or chew the tablets. \n\nPatients with CRPC or mCSPC receiving XTANDI should also receive a gonadotropic -releasing hormone (GnRH) analog \n\nconcurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. \n\nPatients with nmCSPC with high -risk BCR may be treated with XTANDI with or without a GnRH analog. For patients \n\nwho receive XTANDI with or without a GnRH analog, treatment can be suspended if PSA is undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) \n\nafter 36 weeks of therapy. Reinitiate treatment when PSA has increased to ≥ 2.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior radical \n\nprostatectomy or ≥ 5.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior primary radiation therapy [see  Clinical Studies  (14 )] .\n\n2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions \n\nIf a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 or an intolerable adverse reaction, withhold XTANDI for one week or until symptoms \n\nimprove to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted [see  Warnings and \n\nPre cautions  (5.1 , 5.2 )] .\n\n2.3 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions \n\nStrong CYP2C8 Inhibitors \n\nAvoid the coadministration of strong CYP 2C8 inhibitors. If the coadministration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be \n\navoided, reduce the XTANDI dosage to 80 mg once daily. If the coadministration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, \n\nincrease the XTANDI dosage to the dosage used prior to in itiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor [see  Clinical \n\nPharmacology  (12.3 )]. \n\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers \n\nAvoid the coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be \n\navoided, increase the XTANDI dosage from 160 mg to 240 mg orally once daily. If the coadministration of the strong \n\nCYP3A4 inducer is disconti nued, decrease the XTANDI dosage to the dosage used prior to initiation of the strong \n\nCYP3A4 inducer [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3 )]. \n\n# 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \n\nXTANDI 40 mg capsules are white to off -white oblong soft gelatin capsules imprinted in black ink with ENZ. \n\nXTANDI 40 mg tablets are yellow, round, film -coated and debossed with E 40. This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda XTANDI 80 mg tablets are yellow, oval, fil m-coated and debossed with E 80. \n\n# 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \n\nNone. \n\n# 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n\n5.1 Seizure \n\nSeizure occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving XTANDI in eight randomized clinical trials. In these trials, patients with \n\npredisposing factors for seizure were generally excluded. Seizure occurred from 13 to 2250 days after initiation of \n\nXTANDI. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy, and all seizure events resolved. \n\nIn a single -arm trial designed to assess the risk of seizure in patients with pre -disposing factors for seizure, 8 of 366 \n\n(2.2%) XTANDI -treated patients experienced a seizure. Three of the 8 patients experienced a second seizure during \n\ncontinued treatment with XTANDI after their first seizure resolved. It is unknown whether anti -epileptic medications will \n\nprevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following pre -disposing factors: the use of \n\nmedications that may lower the seizure threshold (~ 54%), history of traumatic brain or head injury (~ 28%), history of \n\ncerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (~ 24%), and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal \n\ndisease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, past history of seizure, \n\npresence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection (all \n\n< 5%). Approximately 17% of patients had more than one risk factor. \n\nAdvise patients of the risk of developing a seizur e while receiving XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden \n\nloss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. \n\nPermanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. \n\n5.2 Posterior Reversible Encep halopathy Syndrome (PRES) \n\nThere have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving XTANDI [see \n\nAdverse Reactions  (6.2 )] . PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including \n\nseizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without \n\nassociated hypertens ion. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance \n\nimaging (MRI). Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES. \n\n5.3 Hypersensitivity \n\nHypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0. 1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with \n\nenzalutamide in eight randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post -marketing cases. Advise \n\npatients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and p romptly seek \n\nmedical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions. \n\n5.4 Ischemic Heart Disease \n\nIn the combined data of five randomized, placebo -controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more \n\ncommonly in pa tients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (3.5% vs 2%). Grade 3 -4 ischemic \n\nevents occurred in 1.8% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 1.1% on the placebo arm. Ischemic events led to \n\ndeath in 0.4% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0.1% on the placebo arm. \n\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as \n\nhypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3 -4 ischemic heart disease. This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 5.5 Falls and Fractures \n\nFalls and fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and \n\nmanage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone -targete d\n\nagents. \n\nIn the combined data of five randomized, placebo -controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 12% of patients treated with \n\nXTANDI compared to 6% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or \n\nseizure. Fractures occurred in 13% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 6% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3 -4\n\nfractures occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 1.9% of patients treated with placebo. The median \n\ntime to onset of fracture w as 420 days (range: 1 to 2348 days) for patients treated with XTANDI. Routine bone density \n\nassessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone -targeted agents were not performed in the studies. \n\n5.6 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity \n\nThe safety and efficacy of XTANDI h ave not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and \n\nmechanism of action, XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. \n\nAdvise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI \n\nand for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [see  Use in Specific Populations  (8. 1, 8.3 )] .\n\n# 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nThe following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \n\n• Seizure [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.1 )] \n\n• Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.2 )] \n\n• Hypersensitivity [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.3 )] \n\n• Ischemic Heart Disease [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.4 )] \n\n• Falls an d Fractures [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.5 )] \n\n6.1 Clinical Trial Experience \n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varyi ng conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials \n\nof a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed \n\nin practice. \n\nThe data in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect eig ht randomized, controlled trials [AFFIRM, PREVAIL, \n\nTERRAIN, PROSPER, ARCHES, EMBARK, Asian PREVAIL (NCT02294461), and STRIVE (NCT01664923)] that \n\nwere pooled to conduct safety analyses in patients with CRPC (N = 3651), mCSPC (N = 752), or nmCSPC with high -risk \n\nBCR (n = 707) treated with XTANDI. Patients received XTANDI 160 mg (N = 5110) or placebo orally once daily (N =\n\n2829) or bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily (N = 387). In these eight trials, the median duration of treatment was 22.1 \n\nmonths (range: < 0.1 to 95.0) in patients that received XTANDI. \n\nIn five placebo -controlled trials (AFFIRM, PROSPER, PREVAIL, ARCHES, and EMBARK), the median duration of \n\ntreatment was 19.4 months (range: < 0.1 to 90.4) in the XTANDI group [see  Clinical Studies  (14 )]. In these five trials, the \n\nmost common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI -treated \n\npatie nts were musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, hot flush, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypertension, \n\nhemorrhage, fall, fracture and headache. This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda AFFIRM: XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy \n\nAFFIRM enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of \n\ntreatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI \n\narm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocortic oids. \n\nGrade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI -treated patients. Discontinuations due to \n\nadverse reactions were reported for 16% of XTANDI -treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to \n\ntreatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI -treated patients compared to none (0%) of \n\nthe placebo -treated patients.

The median duration of treatment at the time of analysis was 18.4 months (range: 0.0 to 42 months) with \n\nXTANDI and 1 1.1 months (range: 0.0 to 43 months) with placebo. \n\nOverall, 32 patients (3.4%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death with ≥ 2 patients \n\nincluded coronary artery disorders (n = 7), sudden death (n = 2), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 2), general physical health \n\ndeterioration (n = 2), stroke (n = 2), and secondary malignancy (n = 5; one each of acute myeloid leukemia, brain \n\nneoplasm, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, and malignant neoplasm of unknown primary site). Three patients \n\n(0 .6%) receiving placebo died from adverse reactions of cardiac arrest (n = 1), left ventricular failure (n = 1), and \n\npancreatic carcinoma (n = 1).

Patients \n\nreceived either XTANDI at a d ose of 160 mg once daily (N = 572) or placebo (N = 574). The median duration of \n\ntreatment was 12.8 months (range: 0.2 to 26.6 months) with XTANDI and 11.6 months (range: 0.2 to 24.6 months) with \n\nplacebo. \n\nOverall, 10 patients (1.7%) receiving XTANDI died f rom adverse reactions. The reasons for death in ≥ 2 patients included \n\nheart disease (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 2). Eight patients (1.4%) receiving placebo died from \n\nadverse reactions. The reasons for death in ≥ 2 patients included heart disease (n = 2) and sudden death (n = 2). Grade 3 or \n\nhigher adverse reactions were reported in 24% of patients treated with XTANDI. Permanent discontinuation due to \n\nadverse reactions as the primary reason was reported in 4.9% of XTANDI -treated patien ts and 3.7% of placebo -treated \n\npatients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in XTANDI -treated patients were \n\nalanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and seizure, each in 0.3%. The most common \n\nadverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in placebo -treated patients were arthralgia, and fatigue, each in \n\n0.3%. \n\nDose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.4% of patients who received XTANDI. Fatigue/asthenia was the \n\nmost frequent adverse reaction requiring dose reduction in 2.1% of XTANDI -treated patients and 0.7% of placebo -treated \n\npatients. \n\nTable 5  shows adverse reactions reported in ARCHES that occurred at a ≥ 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm than \n\nin the placebo arm. \n\nTable 5.

Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If the coadministration of XTANDI \n\nwith a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of XTANDI [see  Dosage and Administration  (2.3 ), \n\nClinical Pharmacology  (12.3 )]. \n\nStrong CYP3A4 Inducers \n\nThe coadministration of XTANDI with rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreases \n\nplasma concentrations of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide, which may decrease the efficacy of XTANDI. \n\nAvoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the coadministration of XTANDI with a strong \n\nCYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of XTANDI [see  Dosage and Administration  (2.3 ),  Clinical \n\nPharmacology  (12.3 )]. \n\n7.2 Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs \n\nCertain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 Substrates \n\nXTANDI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer. The coadministration of XTANDI \n\ndecreases the concentrations of certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates [see  Clinical Pharmac ology  (12.3 )] ,\n\nwhich may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with certain CYP3A4, \n\nCYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates for which a minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failure of the \n\nsubstrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of these substrates in accordance with their \n\nPrescribing Information. In cases where active metabolites are formed, there may be increased exposure to the active \n\nmetabolites. \n\n# 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n\n8.1 Pregnancy \n\nRisk Summary \n\nThe safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and \n\nmechanism of action, XTANDI can cause f etal harm and loss of pregnancy. There are no human data on the use of \n\nXTANDI in pregnant females. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of enzalutamide in pregnant mice \n\nduring organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose \n\n(see Data). This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda Data \n\nAnimal Data \n\nIn an embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study in mice, enzalutamide caused developmental toxicity when administered \n\nat oral doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organog enesis (gestational days 6 -15). Findings included \n\nembryo -fetal lethality (increased post -implantation loss and resorptions) and decreased anogenital distance at \n\n≥ 10 mg/kg/day, and cleft palate and absent palatine bone at 30 mg/kg/day. Doses of 30 mg/kg/da y caused maternal \n\ntoxicity. The doses tested in mice (1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.04, 0.4 \n\nand 1.1 times, respectively, the exposures in patients. Enzalutamide did not cause developmental toxicity in rabbits when \n\nadministered throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6 -18) at dose levels up to 10 mg/kg/day \n\n(approximately 0.4 times the exposures in patients based on AUC). \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study in pregnant rats with a single oral 30 mg/kg enz alutamide administration on gestation day 14, \n\nenzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present in the fetus at a C max that was approximately 0.3 times the concentration \n\nfound in maternal plasma and occurred 4 hours after administration. \n\n8.2 Lactation \n\nRisk Summary \n\nThe safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. There is no information available on the \n\npresence of XTANDI in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk \n\nproduction. Enza lutamide and/or its metabolites were present in milk of lactating rats (see Data) .\n\nData \n\nFollowing a single oral administration in lactating rats on postnatal day 14, enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were \n\npresent in milk at a C max that was 4 times higher than concentrations in the plasma and occurred 4 hours after \n\nadministration. \n\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential \n\nContraception \n\nMales \n\nBased on findings in animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to \n\nuse effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [see  Use in Specific \n\nPopulations  (8.1 )] .\n\nInfertility \n\nMales \n\nBased on animal studies, XTANDI may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see  Nonclinical Toxicology \n\n(13.1 )] .\n\n8.4 Pediatric Use \n\nSafety and effectiveness of XTANDI in pediatric patients have not been established. \n\n8.5 Geriatric Use \n\nOf 5110 p atients who received XTANDI in eight randomized, controlled clinical trials, 78% were 65 and over, while 33% \n\nwere 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger \n\npatients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. \n\n8.6 Renal Impairment \n\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patien ts with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] \n\n≥ 30 mL/min). XTANDI has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or end -stage \n\nrenal disease [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3 )] .\n\n8.7 Hepatic Impairment \n\nNo dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment [see  Clinical \n\nPharmacology  (12.3 )]. \n\n# 10 OVERDOSAGE \n\nIn the event of an overdosage, stop treatment with XTANDI and initiate general supportive measures taking into \n\nconsi deration the half -life of 5.8 days. In a dose escalation study, no seizures were reported at < 240 mg daily, whereas \n\n3 seizures were reported, 1 each at 360 mg, 480 mg, and 600 mg daily. Patients may be at increased risk of seizure \n\nfollowing an overdosage. \n\n# 11 DESCRIPTION \n\nEnzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor. The chemical name is 4 -{3 -[4 -cyano -3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] -5,5 -\n\ndimethyl -4-oxo -2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin -1-yl} -2-fluoro -N-methylbenzamide. \n\nThe molecular weight is 464.44 and molecular for mula is C 21 H16 F4N4O2S. The structural formula is: \n\nEnzalutamide is a white crystalline non -hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water. \n\nXTANDI is available as liquid -filled soft gelatin capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 4 0 mg of \n\nenzalutamide as a solution in caprylocaproyl polyoxylglycerides. The inactive ingredients are caprylocaproyl \n\npolyoxylglycerides, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, gelatin, sorbitol sorbitan solution, glycerin, \n\npurified water, tita nium dioxide, and black iron oxide. \n\nXTANDI is also available as film -coated tablets for oral administration. Each tablet contains 40 mg or 80 mg of \n\nenzalutamide. The inactive ingredients are hypromellose acetate succinate, microcrystalline cellulose, collo idal silicon \n\ndioxide, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The tablet film -coat contains hypromellose, talc, polyethylene \n\nglycol, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide. This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n\n12.1 Mechanism of Action \n\nEnzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. \n\nEnzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors; and consequently, inhibits \n\nnuclear translocation of androgen receptors and their interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N -desmethyl \n\nenzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell \n\ndeath of prostate cancer cells in vitro , and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model. \n\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics \n\nOnce daily dosing of 160 mg enzalutamide in addition to ADT reduced PSA levels to undetectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) in \n\n68% of patients with mCSPC (ARCHES). \n\nBased on the efficacy results of AFFIRM after once daily dosing of 160 mg enzalutamide, no exposure -response \n\nrelationship for the efficacy endpoint of overall survival could be identified. In addition, there was no clinically \n\nmeaningful exposure -response relationship for adverse effects (e.g. fatigue, flushing, headache, or hypertension) within \n\nthe limit ed exposure range for 160 mg/day. \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nAt the recommended dosage, XTANDI does not cause large mean increases (i.e., > 20 msec) in the QT interval. \n\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics \n\nEnzalutamide achieves steady -state by Day 28 and its AUC accumula tes approximately 8.3 -fold relative to a single dose. \n\nAt steady -state, the mean (%CV) maximum concentration (C max ) for enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide are \n\n16.6 μg/mL (23%) and 12.7 μg/mL (30%), respectively, and the mean (%CV) minimum concentrati ons (C min ) are \n\n11.4 μg/mL (26%) and 13.0 μg/mL (30%), respectively. \n\nEnzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of 30 (0.2 times the \n\napproved recommended dosage) to 360 mg (2.25 times the approved recommen ded dosage). \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe median T max is 1 hour (0.5 to 3 hours) following a single 160 mg dose of capsules and 2 hours (0.5 to 6 hours) \n\nfollowing a single 160 mg dose of tablets. \n\nEffect of Food \n\nThere was no clinically meaningful effect on enzalutamide or N -desmethyl enzalutamide pharmacokinetics following the \n\nadministration of XTANDI with a high -fat meal (approximately 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from \n\ncarbohydrates, and 500 to 600 calories from fat). \n\nDistribution \n\nThe mean (%CV) volume of distribution after a single oral dose is 110 L (29%). \n\nEnzalutamide is 97% to 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. N -desmethyl enzalutamide is 95% bound to \n\nplasma proteins. \n\nElimination \n\nEnzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism .This label may not be the latest approved by FDA. For current labeling information, please visit https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide after a single dose is 0.56 L/h (0.33 to 1.02 L/h). The mean terminal \n\nhalf -life (t 1/2 ) for enzalutamide after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (2.8 to 10.2 days). The mean terminal t 1/2 for \n\nN-desmethyl enz alutamide is approximately 7.8 to 8.6 days. \n\nMetabolism \n\nEnzalutamide is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active \n\nmetabolite (N -desmethyl enzalutamide). Carboxylesterase 1 metabolizes N -desmethyl enzal utamide and enzalutamide to \n\nthe inactive carboxylic acid metabolite. \n\nSpecific Populations \n\nNo clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were observed based on age (41 to 92 \n\nyears), race (White, Chinese, and Japanese), body we ight (46 kg to 163 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ \n\n30 mL/min) and hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh A, B, and C). Severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease (CLcr \n\n< 30 mL/min) have not been studied. \n\nDrug Interaction Studies \n\nClinical St udies \n\nEffect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg with gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 \n\ninhibitor) increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2 -fold with minimal effect on C max .\n\nEffect of CYP3A4 and CYP 2C8 Inducers on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg after multiple oral doses \n\nof rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl \n\nenzalutamide by 37% with no effect on C max .\n\nEffect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg after multiple oral doses of \n\nitraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3 -fold \n\nwith no effect on C max .\n\nEffect of XTANDI on Other Drugs: \n\nThe coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) decreased \n\nmidazolam AUC by 86% and C max by 77%. \n\nCoadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with warfarin (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate) decreased \n\nS-warfarin AUC by 56% and C max by 17%. \n\nCoadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with omeprazole (a sensitive CYP2C19 substrate) decreased \n\nomeprazole AUC by 72% and C max by 62%. \n\nCoadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once d aily with digoxin (a P -glycoprotein substrate) increased digoxin AUC \n\nby 33% and C max by 17%. \n\nNo clinically meaningful changes in exposure of pioglitazone (a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate), caffeine (a sensitive \n\nCYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate), or rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) were observed \n\nfollowing coadministrati on with XTANDI. \n\nIn Vitro Studies \n\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes : Enzalutamide induces CYP2B6 at clinically achievable concentrations.

Enzalut amide increased the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors in the testes at all dose levels tested \n\n(≥ 0.3 times the human exposure based on AUC) and combined incidence of urothelial papilloma and carcinoma in the \n\nurinary bladder in male rats at 100 mg/kg/d ay (1.4 times the human exposure based on AUC). The findings in the testes \n\nare considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide. Rats are regarded as more sensitive than \n\nhumans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes. A dministration of enzalutamide to male and female rasH2 \n\ntransgenic mice by oral gavage daily for 26 weeks did not result in increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to \n\n20 mg/kg/day. \n\nEnzalutamide did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutatio n (Ames) assay and was not genotoxic in either the \n\nin vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (Tk) gene mutation assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. \n\nBased on nonclinical findings in repeat -dose toxicology studies, which were consistent with the ph armacological activity \n\nof enzalutamide, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with XTANDI. In a 26 -week study in rats, atrophy of the \n\nprostate and seminal vesicles was observed at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (equal to the human exposure based on AUC). In 4 -, 13 -,\n\nand 39 -week studies in dogs, hypospermatogenesis and atrophy of the prostate and epididymides were observed at \n\n≥ 4 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the human exposure based on AUC). \n\n# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n\nThe efficacy of XTANDI in patients with CRPC (N = 4692), mCSPC (N = 1150), or nmCSPC with high -risk BCR \n\n(N = 1068) was demonstrated in six randomized, multicenter clinical trials. Patients received concomitant GnRH therapy \n\nor had prior bilateral orchiectomy, unless otherwise indicated. \n\nAFFIRM (NCT00974311): XTANDI vers us Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy \n\nIn AFFIRM, a total of 1199 patients who had received prior docetaxel -based chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to \n\nreceive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 800) or placebo orally onc e daily (N = 399). Study \n\ntreatment continued until disease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal -related event, or clinical \n\nprogression), initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Pat ients with a \n\nprevious history of seizure, taking medicines known to decrease the seizure threshold, or with other risk factors for seizure \n\nwere not eligible [see  Warnings and Precautions  (5.1 )] .\n\nThe following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The \n\nmedian age was 69 years (range 41 -92) and the racial distribution was 92.7% Whi te, 3.9% Black, 1.1% Asian, and 2.1% \n\nOther. Ninety -two percent of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0 -1 and 28% had a mean Brief Pain \n\nInventory score of ≥ 4. Ninety -one percent of patients had metastases in bone and 23% had visceral involvem ent in the \n\nlung and/or liver. Fifty -nine percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 41% had PSA -only \n\nprogression on study entry. All patients had received prior docetaxel -based therapy and 24% had received two cytotoxic \n\nchemot herapy regimens. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm \n\nreceived glucocorticoids. \n\nA statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre -specified interim analysis at the \n\ntime of 520 deaths in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm ( Table 9  and  Figure 2).

Kaplan -Meier Curves of Overall Survival in AFFIRM \n\nPREVAIL (NCT01212991): XTANDI versus Placebo in Chemotherapy -naïve Metastatic CRPC \n\nIn PREVAIL, 1717 chemotherapy -naïve patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of \n\n160 mg once daily (N = 872) or placebo orally once daily (N = 845). Patients with visceral metastases, patients with a \n\nhistory of mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA class I or II), and patients taking medications associated with lowering \n\nthe seizure threshold were allowed. Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to \n\nseizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded. Study treatment continued until \n\ndisease progression (evidence of radiographic progression, a skeletal -related event, or clinical progression) and the \n\ninitiation of a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Overall survival \n\nand radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) were asses sed. Radiographic progression was assessed with the use of \n\nsequential imaging and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate \n\nCancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria) and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) \n\ncriteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. The primary analysis of rPFS utilized centrally reviewed radiographic \n\nassessment of progression. \n\nPatient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balance d between the treatment arms at entry. The median \n\nage was 71 years (range 42 -93) and the racial distribution was 77% White, 10% Asian, 2% Black and 11% Other. The \n\nECOG performance status score was 0 for 68% of patients, and 1 for 32% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0 -1\n\n(asymptomatic) in 67% of patients, and 2 -3 (mildly symptomatic) in 32% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain \n\nInventory Short Form (worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry). Fifty -four percent of patients had radiographic \n\nevi dence of disease progression and 43% had PSA -only progression.

During the study, 27% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 30% of patients on the placebo \n\narm received glucocortico ids for varying reasons. \n\nA statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre -specified interim analysis, \n\nconducted after 540 deaths, in patients treated with XTANDI compared to those treated with placebo ( Table 10 ). Forty \n\npercent of XTANDI -treated and 70% of placebo -treated patients received subsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that \n\nmay prolong overall survival. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed. The m edian \n\nfollow -up time was 31 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre -specified interim \n\nanalysis ( Table 10 , Figure 3). At the updated analysis, 52% of XTANDI -treated a nd 81% of placebo -treated patients had \n\nreceived subsequent therapies that may prolong overall survival in metastatic CRPC. XTANDI was used as a subsequent \n\ntherapy in 2% of XTANDI -treated patients and 29% of placebo -treated patients. \n\nTable 10.

The median TTA \n\nwas 39.6 months for patients on XTANDI and was 17.7 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.21; 95% CI: [0.17, 0.26], \n\np < 0.0001). \n\nARCHES (NCT02677896): XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CSPC \n\nARCHES enrolled 1150 patients with mCSPC who were randomized 1:1 to receive XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg \n\nonce daily (N = 574) or placebo orally once daily (N = 576). A ll patients in the trial received a GnRH analog or had a \n\nprior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were stratified by volume of disease (low vs high) and prior docetaxel therapy for \n\nprostate cancer (no prior docetaxel, 1 -5 cycles, or 6 prior cycles). High volu me of disease is defined as metastases \n\ninvolving the viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, there must be 4 or more bone lesions, at least 1 of which must \n\nbe in a bony structure beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone. Treatment with concurren t docetaxel was not \n\nallowed. Patients continued treatment until radiographic disease progression, initiation of new treatment, unacceptable \n\ntoxicity, or withdrawal. \n\nThe following patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The \n\nmedian age at randomization was 70 years (range: 42 -92) and 30% were 75 years of age or older. The racial distribution \n\nwas 81% White, 14% Asian, and 1% Black. Sixty -six percent (66%) of patients had a Gleason score of ≥ 8. Thirty -seven \n\npercent (37%) of patients had a low volume of disease and 63% of patients had a high volume of disease. Eighty -two \n\npercent (82%) of patients had no prior docetaxel treatment; 2% of patients had 1 to 5 cycles of docetaxel and 16% of \n\npatients had 6 prio r cycles of docetaxel treatment. Twelve percent (12%) of patients received concomitant bone -targeted \n\nagents (bisphosphonates or RANKL inhibitors) which included both prostate and non -prostate cancer indications. The \n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Perf ormance Status (ECOG PS) score was 0 for 78% of patients and 1 for 22% of \n\npatients at study entry. \n\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) based on blinded independent \n\ncentral review (BICR). Radiographic progre ssion -free survival was defined as the time from randomization to \n\nradiographic disease progression at any time or death within 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Radiographic \n\ndisease progression was defined by identification of 2 or more new bone l esions on a bone scan with confirmation \n\n(Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria) and/or progression in soft tissue disease. Time to new antineoplastic therapy \n\nand OS were additional efficacy endpoints. \n\nXTANDI demonstrated a statistically significant impr ovement in rPFS and OS compared to placebo.

All \n\npatients had prior definitive therapy with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (including brachytherapy) with curative \n\nintent, or both. Patients were not candidates for salvage radiotherapy at the time of enrollment. Patients were requir ed to \n\nhave confirmation of non -metastatic disease by BICR, high -risk BCR (defined by a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months), and \n\nPSA values ≥1 ng/mL if they had prior radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as the primary treatment for \n\nprostate cance r or PSA values at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had prior radiotherapy only. \n\nPatients were stratified by screening PSA (≤10 ng/mL vs. >10 ng/mL), PSA doubling time (≤3 months versus >3 months \n\nto ≤ 9 months), and prior hormonal therapy. For patients whose PSA values were undetectable (<0.2 ng/mL) at week 36, \n\ntreatment was suspended at week 37 and then reinitiated when PSA values increased to ≥2.0 ng/mL for patients with prior \n\nprostatectomy or ≥5.0 ng/mL for patients without prior prostatectom y. For patients whose PSA values were detectable \n\n(≥2.0 ng/mL) at week 36, treatment continued without suspension until permanent treatment discontinuation criteria were \n\nmet. For all patients, treatment was permanently discontinued upon radiographic disease progression confirmed by BICR, \n\ninitiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. \n\nThe median age at randomization was 69 years (range: 49 -93) and 23% were 75 years of age or older. The racial \n\ndistribution was 83% White, 7% Asian, 4% Black, 2.3 % Other s, and 2.7% not reported; 5.5% of patients were Hispanic or \n\nLatino. The median PSADT was 4.9 months. Seventy -four percent (74%) of patients had prior definitive therapy with \n\nradical prostatectomy, 34% of patients had prior primary radiotherapy (including br achytherapy), and 49% of patients had \n\nprior therapy with both surgery and radiotherapy (including adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy). Thirty -two percent (32%) \n\nof patients had a Gleason score of ≥ 8. The ECOG PS score was 0 for 92% of patients and 1 for 8% of patients at study \n\nentry. \n\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was metastasis -free survival (MFS) in patients randomized to receive XTANDI plus \n\nleuprolide compared to patients randomized to receive placebo plus leuprolide. MFS was defined as the time from \n\nrandomization to whichever of the following occurred first 1) radiographic progression per BICR or 2) death. MFS in \n\npatients randomized to receive XTANDI as a single agent compared to patients randomized to receive placebo plus \n\nleuprolide and overall surv ival (OS) were additional efficacy outcome measures. \n\nA statistically significant improvement in MFS was demonstrated in patients randomized to receive XTANDI plus \n\nleuprolide compared with patients randomized to receive placebo plus leuprolide. A statistic ally significant improvement \n\nin MFS was also demonstrated in patients randomized to receive XTANDI as a single agent compared with patients \n\nrandomized to receive placebo plus leuprolide.
