147482,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms - Clinical,Overall And Progression-Free Survival In Patients Treated With Fedratinib As First-Line Myelofibrosis (Mf) Therapy And After Prior Ruxolitinib (Rux): Results From The Jakarta And Jakarta2 Trials,First-Line;;Myelofibrosis,First-Line Myelofibrosis,First-Line Myelofibrosis;;Previously Treated Myelofibrosis,True,abstract_title,"Step-by-step extraction process:
1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title was chosen over the session title because it contains a more specific disease term, 'Myelofibrosis (Mf)', compared to the broader 'Myeloproliferative Neoplasms' in the session title. This adheres to the single-source principle.

2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title contains two distinct patient populations for the disease 'Myelofibrosis':
    *   Patients receiving therapy as 'First-Line'.
    *   Patients treated 'After Prior Ruxolitinib'.

3.  **Rule Retrieval and Application**:
    *   For the 'First-Line' component, I retrieved rules for 'Line of treatment'. The rules (e.g., ID: 198, 200) state that when 'first-line' modifies a therapy or disease concept (as in 'First-Line Myelofibrosis...Therapy'), it should be retained, standardized to 'First-Line', and placed at the beginning of the indication. This leads to the first indication: `First-Line Myelofibrosis`.
    *   For the 'After Prior Ruxolitinib' component, this phrase describes a patient's treatment history. This is a specific instance of a 'Previously Treated' patient subgroup. Rules for 'Treatment Status' confirm that such descriptors should be included. Therefore, this cohort is normalized to `Previously Treated Myelofibrosis`.

4.  **Indication Construction**: The title explicitly separates these two populations with 'And', indicating two distinct groups are being analyzed. Therefore, two separate indications are generated and combined using the ';;' delimiter as required.

5.  **Final Quality Check**: Generic rules were applied. The disease term 'Myelofibrosis' is singular and in Title Case. Procedural details like drug names ('Fedratinib', 'Ruxolitinib') and trial names ('Jakarta', 'Jakarta2') were correctly excluded. The final output accurately reflects the two clinically distinct patient populations described in the abstract title.","[{'category': 'Treatment Set-up', 'subcategories': ['Line of treatment'], 'reason': ""To correctly handle the 'First-Line' descriptor and determine if it should be included in the final indication.""}]","[{'component': 'First-Line Myelofibrosis (Mf) Therapy', 'type': 'Disease with Line of Treatment', 'normalized_form': 'First-Line Myelofibrosis', 'rule_applied': ""Rule ID: 200 - Standardize 'first line' to 'First-Line' and place at the beginning of the indication.""}, {'component': 'After Prior Ruxolitinib', 'type': 'Patient Subgroup (Treatment Status)', 'normalized_form': 'Previously Treated', 'rule_applied': 'Generic rule for normalizing specific treatment history to a standard patient subgroup descriptor.'}, {'component': 'Myelofibrosis (Mf)', 'type': 'Disease', 'normalized_form': 'Myelofibrosis', 'rule_applied': 'Generic rule for singular form and title case.'}]",2

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Genomic Landscape of RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder with Myeloid Malignancies Reveals Rising Clonal Hematopoiesis') was chosen over the session title because it contains specific, multiple disease entities, making it the more informative source, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: Three distinct clinical entities were identified in the abstract title:
    a. 'RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder'
    b. 'Myeloid Malignancies'
    c. 'Clonal Hematopoiesis'
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: Rules were retrieved for handling multiple diseases, familial qualifiers, and gene names.
    - `Patient with two different Disease`: No specific rule for the connector 'with' was found, defaulting to the generic rule of separating distinct diseases with ';;'.
    - `Patient Sub-Group` for 'Familial': The rules confirm that 'Familial' should be retained as a prefix to the disease it modifies.
    - `Gene Name` for 'RUNX1': The rules indicate that a gene name alone is insufficient, but here 'RUNX1' is an integral part of the specific disorder's name ('RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder'), not a standalone biomarker, so it must be retained.
4.  **Rule Application and Construction**:
    - **Indication 1**: 'RUNX1-Familial Platelet Disorder' was kept as is, correctly formatted in Title Case with the gene name preserved.
    - **Indication 2**: 'Myeloid Malignancies' was processed using the generic rule for singularization, converting 'Malignancies' to 'Malignancy', resulting in 'Myeloid Malignancy'.

3.  **Rule Application & Normalization**:
    *   **Disease Term**: The plural 'Malignancies' was converted to its singular form 'Malignancy' as per the generic formatting rules.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title was chosen over the session title because it contains a more specific description of the patient population and disease, including the age group, gene, and specific alteration. This adheres to the single-source principle of using the most detailed source.
2.  **Component Identification**: I identified the following key components in the abstract title: 'Adult' (age group), 'AML' (disease), 'Tandem Duplications of the UBTF gene' (genetic alteration), and 'Myelodysplasia' (associated condition).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category to correctly handle the 'Adult' descriptor.
4.  **Component Analysis and Normalization**:
    *   **Disease**: 'AML' was expanded to its full form 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia' and converted to singular Title Case.
    *   **Age Group**: Based on the retrieved 'Adult' rule (ID: 289), the term 'Adult' was prepended to the indication.
    *   **Genetic Alteration**: 'Tandem Duplications of the UBTF gene' was standardized to 'UBTF Tandem Duplication'. The gene symbol 'UBTF' is kept in its original uppercase form, and the alteration is formatted in Title Case. This component acts as a primary qualifier for the disease.
    *   **Associated Condition**: 'Myelodysplasia' was considered. However, the phrasing 'Associated with Myelodysplasia' indicates it is a characteristic or outcome of the primary disease cohort (Adult AML with UBTF duplication) rather than a separate, parallel indication being studied. Therefore, it was excluded from the final indication string to maintain focus on the core patient group.
    *   **Occurrence**: The term 'Recurrent Alteration' was identified. This describes the nature of the genetic finding itself (i.e., it is a commonly recurring mutation in the population) rather than the patient's disease status (e.g., relapsed/refractory). Thus, it was not included as a disease state qualifier like 'Recurrent'.

4. **Rule Application and Normalization**:
    - **Disease**: The term 'Leukemia' is already in singular form and was converted to Title Case.
    - **Gene Information**: The term 'KMT2A-rearranged' was normalized to 'KMT2A-Rearranged' based on the retrieved 'Gene Rearranged' rule (ID 48), which specifies the format '<Gene>-Rearranged'.
    - **Age Groups**: The terms 'Infant' and 'Childhood' were identified as distinct patient subgroups. The retrieved 'Age Group' rules (ID 291, 292) state that these descriptors should be placed at the beginning of the indication.
    - **Occurrence Status**: The term 'Relapse' was converted to 'Relapsed' as per the 'Relapse' occurrence rule (ID 144), which standardizes the term to its adjectival form and places it before the disease name.
5. **Indication Construction**: The components were assembled for each age group, creating two distinct indications. The structure followed is [Age Group] [Occurrence] [Gene Info] [Disease].

1.  **Analyze Input Titles**: The session title is 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia - Clinical'. The abstract title is 'Induced Systemic T-Cell Specific Responses To Multiple Tumor-Associated Antigens After Allogenic Leukemia-Derived Dendritic Cell Vaccine Dcp-001 In Aml Patients With Persistent Mrd'.
2.  **Select Source**: Both titles contain a disease term ('Acute Myeloid Leukemia' and its abbreviation 'Aml'). According to the single-source principle, the abstract title is preferred as it is more specific.
3.  **Identify Components**: From the abstract title, I identified the core disease 'Aml' and a specific patient subgroup 'Patients With Persistent Mrd'. 'Aml' is the standard abbreviation for 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia'. 'MRD' stands for 'Minimal Residual Disease', and 'Persistent MRD' is a clinically significant descriptor of the disease state, defining a specific patient cohort.
4.  **Retrieve Rules**: I retrieved rules for the 'Patient Sub-Group' category with the 'Disease Characterisation' subcategory to check for guidance on terms like 'Persistent'. While no specific rule for 'Persistent' or 'MRD' was found, the general principle is to include clinically significant descriptors that define a subgroup.
5.  **Apply Rules & Construct Indication**: 
    *   The disease 'Aml' was expanded to its full name: 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia'.
    *   The patient subgroup 'Persistent Mrd' was identified as a key qualifier.
    *   Generic formatting rules were applied: The qualifier is placed before the disease name. The connector 'With' is removed. The final string is converted to Title Case, keeping the acronym 'MRD' in its original uppercase form.
    *   Procedural details ('After Allogenic Leukemia-Derived Dendritic Cell Vaccine') and general terms ('Patients') were excluded as per the generic exclusion rules.
6.  **Quality Check**: The final indication 'Persistent MRD Acute Myeloid Leukemia' is derived solely from the abstract title, is in the correct format (Title Case, singular), includes the specific patient subgroup, and excludes irrelevant information.

2. **Component Identification**: I identified two key components in the abstract title: the core disease, 'Glomerular Disease', and the patient subgroup qualifier, 'Collagen Variants'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Gene type' and 'Patient Sub-Group' to determine the correct formatting for genetic qualifiers. Although no specific rule for 'Variant' was found, I applied the general principles of standardization derived from similar rules.
4. **Rule Application**: I applied the generic rules. The 'Singular Form' rule was applied to the qualifier 'Variants', converting it to 'Variant'. The 'Title Case' rule was applied to format the final indication.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title is 'Randomized control trial of ultrasonic propulsion to facilitate clearance of chronic residual fragments'. The session title is 'LBA01: Late-breaking Abstract I - Benign'.
2. **Select Source**: According to the single-source principle, the abstract title is preferred as it contains a specific medical condition ('chronic residual fragments'). The session title's term 'Benign' is too generic and lacks a specific disease context.
3. **Identify Components**: The key phrase identified in the abstract title is 'chronic residual fragments'.
4. **Retrieve Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' and 'Disease Characterisation' to check for any specific guidance on terms like 'residual' or 'chronic'. The generic rules for 'Chronic' are most relevant.
5. **Apply Rules**: 
   - **Generic Rule (Chronic)**: The term 'chronic' is included as it is part of the condition's name, describing its persistent nature, not the duration of a treatment.
   - **Generic Rule (Singular Form)**: The plural 'fragments' is converted to its singular form, 'Fragment'.
   - **Generic Rule (Title Case)**: The final indication is formatted in Title Case.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting, I retrieved rules for 'Line of treatment' and 'Recurrent/Refractory' categories.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Treatment Line**: Based on the retrieved 'Line of treatment' rules (specifically Rule ID 199 and 202), the phrase 'Second-Line Therapy for...' indicates that 'Second-Line' modifies the disease context, not a specific drug. Therefore, it must be retained and normalized to 'Second-Line'.
    *   **Disease State**: The phrase 'Relapsed or Refractory' is a standard patient subgroup descriptor. It is normalized to 'Relapsed/Refractory' with a slash, following common clinical terminology standards.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title, 'Controversies in the Management of Dyslipidemia in Children with CKD', was chosen as it clearly contains the diseases and patient population, aligning with the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: I identified two distinct medical conditions, 'Dyslipidemia' and 'CKD' (Chronic Kidney Disease), and one patient subgroup descriptor, 'Children'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for the keyword 'Children'. The rules (e.g., ID 293, 294) mandate replacing 'Children' with the prefix 'Childhood' and placing it before the associated disease names.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   Applying the age group rule, 'Dyslipidemia in Children' was transformed into 'Childhood Dyslipidemia'.
    *   The context '...in Children with CKD' links the age group to CKD as well, resulting in 'Childhood CKD'.
    *   The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, which requires listing all distinct indications separated by ';;'.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: The `get_indication_rules` tool was used for the 'Gene type' category to determine how to handle 'Variants'. While no explicit rule for 'Variant' exists, the rule for 'Gene Mutation' (ID: 30) provides the closest and most clinically appropriate standardization, which is to convert genetic variations into the format '<GENE>-Mutated'.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   The genetic component 'Runx1 Variants' is normalized to 'Runx1-Mutated' based on the logic of the Gene Mutation rule.
    *   The disease term 'Myeloid Neoplasms' is converted to its singular form, 'Myeloid Neoplasm', as per the generic formatting rules.
    *   The phrase 'With High Variant Allele Frequency' is excluded as it describes a technical measurement detail rather than a standard clinical subgroup.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Ordered and selective patterns of cancer genome evolution revealed by lineage tracing of sporadic p53 loss') was chosen over the session title because it contains a specific genetic event ('p53 loss') linked to a disease ('cancer'), making it more specific.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'cancer' and the genetic event 'p53 loss'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Gene type' category were retrieved to correctly handle the genetic event 'p53 loss'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The disease term 'cancer' was normalized to 'Cancer' using the generic Title Case and singular form rules.
   - The genetic event 'p53 loss' was processed. The gene 'p53' is standardized to its official HGNC symbol 'TP53'. The term 'loss' is handled by rules for gene depletion/deficiency (e.g., Rule ID 76 for 'Gene Depleted' which covers 'loss of'). This transforms 'TP53 loss' into the standardized format 'TP53-Depleted'.
5. **Indication Construction**: The normalized components were combined, with the genetic qualifier preceding the disease, resulting in 'TP53-Depleted Cancer'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('State of the art first-line management of patients with advanced RCC') was chosen over the session title because it contains a specific disease term ('RCC') and provides a complete context for the indication. The Single-Source Extraction Principle dictates using the abstract title first.
2.  **Component Identification**: I identified three key components in the abstract title: 'first-line' (treatment line), 'advanced' (disease stage), and 'RCC' (disease).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Stage', 'Treatment Set-up', and 'Patient Sub-Group' to correctly handle these components.
4.  **Component Normalization & Rule Application**:
    *   **Disease**: 'RCC' is a standard medical acronym for 'Renal Cell Carcinoma'. This was expanded and normalized to 'Renal Cell Carcinoma' in Title Case, following generic formatting rules.
    *   **Stage**: The term 'advanced' was identified as a stage descriptor. Based on staging rules, it is prepended to the disease name and formatted as 'Advanced'.
    *   **Treatment Line**: The term 'first-line' modifies 'management', which is a generic term. According to the retrieved 'Line of treatment' rules (specifically Rule ID 199 and 200), when a line descriptor is not followed by a specific drug name, it should be retained, normalized to 'First-Line', and placed at the beginning of the indication.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The normalized components were assembled in the correct clinical order: Treatment Line -> Stage -> Disease. This resulted in 'First-Line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma'.
6.  **Exclusion**: Non-diagnostic phrases like 'State of the art', 'management of', and 'patients with' were excluded as per the generic exclusion rules.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('A Novel Approach Of Dual Metagenomics Next-Generation Sequencing For Early Diagnosis Of Blood Stream Infection In Hematologic Patients With Febrile Neutropenia: A Multicenter, Prospective Study') was chosen over the session title ('Infections and SCT complications') because it contains specific, well-defined medical conditions, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title clearly identifies two distinct medical conditions: 'Blood Stream Infection' and 'Febrile Neutropenia'. The term 'Hematologic Patients' describes the patient population but is a broad descriptor of a patient type rather than a specific disease qualifier, so it is excluded based on the principle of creating concise, disease-focused indications.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I initiated a search for rules related to handling multiple diseases ('Patient with two different Disease') and patient characterization ('Patient Sub-Group'). No specific rule for combining these particular conditions was found, so I proceeded with the generic rules.
4.  **Rule Application**: The generic rule for 'Multiple Diseases' was applied. This rule mandates that if a title mentions multiple distinct diseases, all should be extracted and separated by a double semicolon (';;').
5.  **Indication Construction**: The identified diseases were normalized according to the generic formatting rules:
    *   'Blood Stream Infection' was kept as is (already Title Case and singular).

2.  **Component Identification**: From the abstract title, two key components were identified: the disease 'Kidney Injury' and the patient subgroup 'Extreme Preterm'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category to determine how to handle terms like 'Preterm'. While no specific rule for 'Extreme Preterm' was found, the general principle from related rules (e.g., for 'Pediatric', 'Neonatal') is to retain clinically significant age-based subgroups as a prefix to the disease.
4.  **Rule Application & Normalization**:
    *   The disease term 'Kidney Injury' is already in the correct singular form and Title Case.
    *   The patient subgroup 'Extreme Preterm' is a critical clinical qualifier. It was converted to Title Case.
    *   Generic exclusion rules were applied to discard non-diagnostic terms like 'Mechanisms' and 'Lower Endowment'.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title 'Prevalence Of Second Cancer During Long Term Follow-Up In Hairy Cell Leukemia Patients Treated With Cladribine: A Thirty-Year Experience' contains specific disease terms. The session title also contains disease terms, but the Single-Source Extraction Principle dictates using the abstract title first.
2. **Identify Components**: The abstract title identifies two distinct clinical conditions: 'Hairy Cell Leukemia' and 'Second Cancer'. It also contains the phrase 'Treated With Cladribine'.
3. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Treatment based' to determine how to handle 'Treated With...'. The retrieved rules focus on treatment status (e.g., 'Previously Treated', 'Untreated') and do not apply here. The generic exclusion rule for 'Procedural/Temporal Qualifiers' is more relevant, which states to exclude terms describing treatment procedures ('receiving', 'treated with'). I also checked for rules on handling two diseases, but none were found, so the generic rule of separating with ';;' applies.
4. **Apply Rules**: 
   - **Disease Extraction**: 'Hairy Cell Leukemia' is extracted as a primary indication. 'Second Cancer' is also extracted as a distinct indication, consistent with the generic rule for 'Second Primary'.
   - **Exclusion**: The phrase 'Treated With Cladribine' is excluded as it describes a specific treatment modality, not the core indication itself. 'Patients' and temporal phrases like 'Long Term Follow-Up' and 'A Thirty-Year Experience' are also excluded per generic rules.
   - **Multiple Diseases**: The two extracted indications are treated as separate entities and are separated by the ';;' delimiter as per the generic rule.
   - **Formatting**: Both indications are converted to Title Case and are in singular form.
5. **Construct Indication**: The final indication is constructed by combining the two normalized disease terms: 'Hairy Cell Leukemia' and 'Second Cancer', separated by ';;'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title, 'Identification of molecular biomarkers differentiating malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma from benign leiomyoma', contains specific disease terms. The session title, 'Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers 1', is generic. Therefore, the abstract title was selected as the source based on the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title explicitly mentions two distinct clinical entities: 'malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma' and 'benign leiomyoma'. The core task described is differentiating between these two.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' under the 'Disease Characterisation' subcategory to check for specific handling of terms like 'malignant' and 'benign'. No specific rules were found, so I proceeded with generic rules.
4.  **Rule Application & Construction**:
    *   **Multiple Diseases**: The title presents two distinct conditions being compared. Both must be extracted as separate indications, delimited by ';;'.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Prognostic Factors and Outcomes of Adolescent and Adult Burkitt Lymphoma and Leukemia...') was chosen over the session title ('Aggressive Lymphomas...') because it contains more specific disease names ('Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Leukemia') and patient subgroups, adhering to the single-source principle.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title were:
    - Age Groups: 'Adolescent' and 'Adult'.
    - Diseases: 'Burkitt Lymphoma' and 'Leukemia'.
    - Excludable terms: 'Prognostic Factors and Outcomes', 'Low-Middle Income Country', 'Experience from Hematology Cancer Consortium' were identified as study methodology or geographic descriptors and marked for exclusion per generic rules.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting for the age groups, the `get_indication_rules` tool was used for the category 'Age Group' with subcategories 'Adolescent' and 'Adult'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
    - The retrieved rules (e.g., Rule ID 289 for 'Adult', Rule ID 318 for 'Adolescent') confirmed that the age group should be a capitalized prefix to the disease name (e.g., 'Adult Gastric Cancer').
    - The structure 'Adolescent and Adult Burkitt Lymphoma and Leukemia' implies that both age groups apply to both diseases. This requires creating all four possible combinations.
    - Generic rules were applied: diseases were kept in singular form, Title Case was used, and excluded terms were removed.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title describes medical procedures ('urine cultures', 'cystoscopies', 'ureteral reimplantation') but does not name a disease or condition. The session title, 'MP17: Pediatric Urology: Upper & Lower Urinary Tract', contains a clear patient subgroup ('Pediatric') and anatomical areas of focus ('Upper & Lower Urinary Tract') within a therapeutic area ('Urology'). According to the single-source principle, the session title is selected as it contains actionable indication components.
2. **Component Identification**: From the session title, the following components were identified: 'Pediatric' (age group), 'Upper Urinary Tract' (anatomical location 1), and 'Lower Urinary Tract' (anatomical location 2).
3. **Rule Retrieval**: The presence of 'Pediatric' prompted the retrieval of rules for the 'Age Group' category to ensure correct formatting.
4. **Rule Application**: The retrieved rules for 'Pediatric' (e.g., Rule ID 295) confirm that it should be used as a prefix for the indication. The phrase 'Upper & Lower Urinary Tract' clearly indicates two separate anatomical regions. To create clinically valid indications from these anatomical sites within a urology context, the general term 'Disease' is appended to each.

4.  **Rule Application**:
    *   **Occurrence Rule**: The phrase 'Relapsed and/or Refractory' was standardized to 'Relapsed/Refractory' based on common clinical terminology formatting rules, such as the logic found in Rule ID 189 which merges these concepts.
    *   **Treatment Set-up Rule (ID: 207)**: This rule explicitly states that references to 'Prior Lines' of therapy should be excluded from the final indication as they describe treatment history, not a core indication qualifier. Therefore, the entire phrase 'Who Have Received at Least Two Prior Lines of Therapy Including Lenalidomide and a Proteasome Inhibitor' was removed.
    *   **Generic Rules**: The disease term 'Multiple Myeloma' was already in singular form. The final output was formatted to Title Case.

1. **Analyze Input Titles**: Both the session title ('Nsclc, Early Stage') and the abstract title ('Real-World Outcomes In Stage I-Iii Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Nsclc): Thassos-Intl Study') contain a valid disease. The abstract title is more specific and is therefore selected as the source, following the single-source principle.
2. **Identify Components**: The selected abstract title contains the following components: Disease ('Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Nsclc)'), Stage ('Stage I-Iii'), and Operative Status ('Resectable'). Study-specific terms like 'Real-World Outcomes' and 'Thassos-Intl Study' are identified for exclusion.
3. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: To ensure correct formatting, I retrieved rules for staging and resectability. 
   - `get_indication_rules(category=""Stage"", subcategories=[""Stage number""])` was used for 'Stage I-Iii'. Rule ID 91 confirmed that stage ranges should be standardized.
   - `get_indication_rules(category=""Treatment Set-up"", subcategories=[""Resectable""])` was used for 'Resectable'. Rule ID 236 confirmed that 'Resectable' should be included as a prefix.
4. **Apply Rules & Construct Indication**:
   - **Generic Rules**: The disease 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer' is already in singular form. Title Case is applied to all components. The parenthetical abbreviation '(Nsclc)' is removed as it's redundant.
   - **Stage Rule**: 'Stage I-Iii' is normalized to 'Stage I-III' for standardized representation, using Roman numerals as is standard for cancer staging.
   - **Treatment Set-up Rule**: 'Resectable' is capitalized and placed at the beginning of the indication.
5. **Final Assembly**: The components are combined in the standard clinical order: [Operative Status] [Stage] [Disease]. This results in 'Resectable Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer'.

The abstract title is 'Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Transplantation (Hsct) In Patients Over 60 Years. Retrospective Experience Of Two Spanish Centers Between 2015-2020' and the session title is 'Stem cell transplantation - Clinical'.
Step 2: I applied the Single-Source Extraction Principle. Neither title contains a specific disease or disorder. Both titles refer to a medical procedure ('Stem cell transplantation' and 'Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Transplantation').
Step 3: The abstract title contains a patient subgroup ('Over 60 Years'). I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category to understand how to handle this. Rule ID 303 indicates that 'Above 60' or similar phrases should be normalized to 'Elderly'.
Step 4: However, according to the generic rules, an indication cannot be created from a patient subgroup alone. A disease term must be present in the same source title.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Impact of Primary Kidney Disease on the Effects of Empagliflozin in Patients with CKD') was chosen over the session title ('Interventions to Reduce CKD Progression') because it is more specific and contains the core disease terms for the study population, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title explicitly mentions two distinct medical conditions: 'Primary Kidney Disease' and 'CKD' (Chronic Kidney Disease).
3.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Multiple Diseases Rule**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, which states that if a title mentions multiple distinct diseases, all should be extracted and separated by ';;'. The structure 'Impact of [Disease A] in Patients with [Disease B]' is analogous to the example 'Outcomes in [Disease A] with [Factor B]', leading to the extraction of both conditions.

Therefore, the abstract title is selected as the source based on the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
3. **Identify Components**: The abstract title identifies two distinct clinical conditions: 'Uncontrolled Hypertension' and 'Graft Failure'. The patient group is 'Kidney Transplant Recipients'.
4. **Retrieve Relevant Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Treatment Set-up' with the subcategory 'Transplant Status' to determine how to handle 'Kidney Transplant Recipients'. The rules (e.g., ID 232, 233 for 'Post-Transplant') indicate that procedural and temporal qualifiers defining a patient group should be excluded from the indication itself.
5. **Apply Rules & Construct Indication**:
   - 'Uncontrolled Hypertension' is identified as a primary indication.
   - 'Graft Failure' is also a distinct clinical condition mentioned in the title and is extracted as a second indication.
   - The patient descriptor 'in Kidney Transplant Recipients' is excluded as it describes the context/procedure status of the patient population, not the disease itself, consistent with the retrieved rules and generic exclusion principles.
   - The two indications are formatted in Title Case and separated by ';;' as per formatting rules.

2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'Thalassemia' and the patient subgroup 'Children'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Pediatric', were retrieved to determine the correct handling of the term 'Children'.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The generic exclusion rule was applied to remove procedural context, specifically 'Gvhd Prophylaxis' and 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation'.
   - The retrieved 'Age Group' rules (ID 295, 296) mandate normalizing age-related terms like 'Children' to the standard form 'Pediatric' and placing it at the beginning of the indication.
   - The generic casing rule was applied to ensure the final indication is in Title Case.
   - The generic singular form rule was applied, although 'Thalassemia' is already singular.

2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title was parsed to identify key clinical components: 'Pediatric' (Age Group), 'Relapsed/Resistant/Intolerant' (Disease State), 'Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive' (Chromosome Type), 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' (Disease), and 'T315I Mutation' (Gene Mutation).
3.  **Handling Multiple Indications**: The presence of 'Or' indicates two distinct patient populations, leading to the extraction of two separate indications for the same disease.
4.  **Rule Retrieval and Application**:
    *   **Indication 1**: 'Pediatric Patients With Relapsed/Resistant/Intolerant Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'
        *   'Pediatric' was retained as the leading qualifier per the 'Age Group' rule (ID: 295).
        *   'Relapsed/Resistant/Intolerant' was normalized to the standard clinical trial terminology 'Relapsed/Refractory' based on 'Occurrence' rules.
        *   'Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive' was standardized to 'Ph Chromosome-Positive' as per the 'Chromosome type' rule (ID: 81).
        *   The disease 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' was kept in its standard Title Case singular form.
    *   **Indication 2**: '[Pediatric Patients] With T315I Mutation [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia]'
        *   The context implies this group is also 'Pediatric' with 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'.
        *   'T315I Mutation' was normalized to 'T315I-Mutated' following the 'Gene type' rule for mutations (ID: 30), which specifies the '<GENE>-Mutated' format.
5.  **Final Construction**: The normalized components for both indications were assembled in the correct clinical order (Age -> State -> Genetic Marker -> Disease).

The abstract title, 'Outcomes Associated with Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Real-World Analysis Using a Global Federated Database', and the session title, 'Kidney Transplantation: New Translational Insights', both revolve around the concept of 'Kidney Transplant'.

Step 2: I identified 'Kidney Transplant Recipients' and 'Kidney Transplantation' as the key patient population descriptors.

Step 3: To determine how to handle these terms, I used the `get_indication_rules` tool for the category 'Treatment Set-up' and subcategory 'Transplant Status'.

Step 4: The retrieved rules (e.g., Rule ID 232 for 'Post-Transplant') clearly state that transplant-related statuses should be excluded from the final indication because they describe a procedural or temporal status rather than a distinct clinical disease entity. The generic exclusion rules also state to exclude 'Procedural/Temporal Qualifiers'.

Step 5: Applying this rule, I must exclude 'Kidney Transplant Recipients' from the abstract title and 'Kidney Transplantation' from the session title. After excluding these terms, neither title contains any remaining disease or disorder. Therefore, a valid medical indication cannot be extracted from either source.

Step 6: Since no indication could be formed, the selected source is 'none' and the generated indication is an empty string.","[{'category': 'Treatment Set-up', 'subcategories': ['Transplant Status'], 'reason': ""To determine the correct handling of terms like 'Kidney Transplant Recipients' and 'Kidney Transplantation'.""}]","[{'component': 'Kidney Transplant Recipients', 'type': 'Patient Sub-Group', 'normalized_form': '', 'rule_applied': 'Rule 232 (Post-Transplant) and Generic Exclusion Rule for Procedural/Temporal Qualifiers.

    *   **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied. The title describes a cohort of patients defined by two conditions (cancer and COVID-19). Both are extracted as separate indications, separated by ';;'.
    *   **Age Group**: The retrieved rule for 'Adult' (ID: 289) specifies prefixing the indication with 'Adult'. This prefix is applied to both identified conditions.
    *   **Formatting**: Generic rules were applied to ensure Title Case ('Cancer') and singular form. 'COVID-19' is maintained in its standard uppercase form.
    *   **Exclusion**: The phrase 'Tertiary cancer center experience' describes the study setting and is correctly excluded from the indication.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Gene type', 'Stage', 'Occurrence', and 'Treatment based' to guide the standardization of these components.
4.  **Rule Application & Standardization**:
    *   **Disease Name**: 'Nsclc' was expanded to its full form 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer' and standardized to Title Case along with its subtype, resulting in 'Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer'.
    *   **Gene Mutation**: 'Egfr-Mutant' was standardized to 'EGFR-Mutant', ensuring the gene symbol is in uppercase as per standard convention.
    *   **Stage/Occurrence**: The phrase 'Locally Advanced Or Metastatic' was identified. While Rule 177 suggests consolidating 'advanced' and 'metastatic' into 'Locally Advanced Metastatic', the explicit use of 'or' in a clinical trial title is significant and was retained for precision. The phrase was converted to Title Case: 'Locally Advanced or Metastatic'.
    *   **Progression Status**: The clause 'Who Have Progression Following Egfr-Tki Treatment' clearly defines the disease state. Based on Occurrence Rule 184 ('Progressive'), this was concisely and accurately standardized to the term 'Progressive'.

   - **Line of Treatment**: Based on Treatment Set-up Rule ID 201, '1L' was normalized to 'First-Line'. Rule ID 199 confirmed that 'First-Line' should be retained because it modifies the generic term 'Therapy', not a specific drug.
   - **Disease State**: 'Advanced/Metastatic (Adv/Met)' was combined and normalized to 'Advanced Metastatic', a standard clinical descriptor for this stage of cancer.
   - **Biomarker**: 'With Pd-L1 Expression' was interpreted as a positive biomarker status. Following common clinical terminology patterns (e.g., HER2-Positive), it was normalized to 'PD-L1-Positive'. The casing for 'PD-L1' was standardized to all-caps as per generic rules.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Jak2V617F Allele Burden: An Independent Predictor Of Overt Fibrosis In Primary Myelofibrosis') was chosen over the session title ('Myeloproliferative Neoplasms - Clinical') because it contains a more specific disease entity ('Primary Myelofibrosis') and a genetic marker, adhering to the single-source principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'Primary Myelofibrosis' and the gene variant 'Jak2V617F'. The term 'Overt Fibrosis' was identified as an outcome being predicted, not a descriptor of the patient population itself, and was therefore excluded from the indication.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: Rules for 'Gene type' were retrieved to correctly format the 'Jak2V617F' variant. Generic rules for disease characterization were also applied.
4.  **Rule Application and Normalization**:
    *   **Disease Term**: The term 'Primary' was retained as it is an integral part of the disease name 'Primary Myelofibrosis'. The term was converted to Title Case.

1.  **Source Selection**: Both the abstract title and session title contain the disease 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia'. The abstract title is chosen as the source because it provides more specific information, namely the chromosomal translocation 'T(6;9)(P22;Q34)', which defines a key patient subgroup. This adheres to the single-source principle, prioritizing the more detailed title.
2.  **Component Identification**: The selected abstract title contains:
    *   Disease: 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Aml)'
    *   Patient Subgroup (Genetic Marker): 'T(6;9)(P22;Q34)'
    *   Excluded terms: 'Utility Of Flt3 Inhibitors' (treatment), 'Patients' (generic descriptor).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Chromosome type' to understand how to handle the cytogenetic notation and 'Connectors' to determine how to join the disease and the genetic marker.
4.  **Rule Application**:
    *   The retrieved 'Chromosome type' rules were not directly applicable to this specific translocation format, so the standard cytogenetic nomenclature 'T(6;9)(P22;Q34)' was preserved as it is clinically precise.
    *   The connector 'And' in the title links the disease to the translocation. The most clinically accurate representation is to use 'with' to connect the disease and its defining characteristic.
    *   Generic rules were applied: The redundant abbreviation '(Aml)' was removed. The output was formatted to Title Case, with the preposition 'with' in lower case per casing rules. The disease term 'Leukemia' is already in singular form.

Step 2: The components identified in the session title are 'Young', 'Oncologist', and 'Tumor'.
Step 3: Rules for the 'Age Group' category were retrieved for the term 'Young'. The rules indicate that 'Young' as a standalone descriptor should be excluded unless it is part of a specific phrase like 'Young Adult'. In this context, 'Young' describes the oncologist, not the patient, so it falls under the generic exclusion rule for non-patient descriptors.
Step 4: The term 'Oncologist' points to the therapeutic area of Oncology, which can be mapped to 'Cancer' per generic rules. The title also explicitly contains the disease term 'Tumor'. 'Tumor' is more specific and directly mentioned in the context of the 'Molecular Tumor Board'.
Step 5: The term 'Molecular' describes the type of tumor board (a meeting/methodology) and not the tumor itself, so it is excluded as a procedural/methodological qualifier.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Sleep Characterization of Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease...') was chosen because it contains a specific disease ('Sickle Cell Disease'), whereas the session title ('Outcomes Research-Non-Malignant Conditions: Poster I') is a broad, non-specific category. This adheres to the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
2.  **Component Identification**: The selected title contains one disease and two distinct patient subgroups based on age: 
    - Disease: 'Sickle Cell Disease'
    - Age Groups: 'Adolescent' and 'Young Adult'.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting for the age groups, I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Adolescent', 'Young', and 'Adult' subcategories.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    - The generic rule for singular form was applied, though 'Sickle Cell Disease' is already singular.
    - The generic rule for Title Case was applied.
    - The retrieved rules for 'Adolescent' (Rule 318) and 'Young Adult' (Rule 311) confirm they should be used as prefixes to the disease name.
    - The presence of 'and' connecting two distinct patient subgroups ('Adolescent and Young Adult') implies that the study covers both groups. Following the pattern for handling multiple distinct groups (similar to Rule 314 for 'Children/Adolescent'), the indication is split into two, one for each age group, with the core disease duplicated.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The two indications were constructed separately and then combined:
    - Indication 1: 'Adolescent' + 'Sickle Cell Disease' -> 'Adolescent Sickle Cell Disease'

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title, ""Biomarker-Based Stratification in Osteoarthritis Patients and in Those at Risk: Advances in the Field"", contains the specific disease term ""Osteoarthritis"". The session title also mentions ""Knee OA"", but per the single-source principle, the abstract title is preferred as it contains a clear disease term.
2.  **Component Identification**: The abstract title identifies two distinct populations related to the same disease:
    *   ""Osteoarthritis Patients"": This directly indicates the disease `Osteoarthritis`.
    *   ""Those at Risk"": This identifies a patient subgroup defined by their risk status for the same disease.
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Risk' category to understand how to handle terms like ""at Risk"".

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Compliance, adverse events and quality of life of patients in a phase 3 study comparing temozolomide with PCV as adjuvant chemotherapy in grade 2 and 3 glioma.') was chosen over the session title ('Central Nervous System Tumors') because it contains a specific disease with qualifiers ('grade 2 and 3 glioma'), adhering to the Single-Source Extraction Principle.
2. **Component Identification**: The key components identified in the abstract title are the disease 'glioma' and the grade qualifiers 'grade 2 and 3'.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: The `get_indication_rules` tool was used for the 'Grade' category to understand how to handle numeric grades. Rule ID 119 (for Grade 2) and similar rules for other grades confirmed that Arabic numerals should be converted to Roman numerals (2 -> II, 3 -> III) and that multiple grades mentioned together should be split into separate indications.

   - **Chromosome Type**: While no specific rule dictated the exact formatting for '11Q23 Rearranged', it is a critical clinical descriptor defining a specific subtype of leukemia. It was retained as a qualifier.
   - **Generic Formatting Rule**: The disease term 'Acute Leukemia' is already singular and was converted to Title Case. The qualifier '11Q23 Rearranged' was standardized to '11q23-Rearranged' for clarity and common clinical notation, prepending it to the disease name.
   - The term 'Frequent' was excluded as it describes the incidence of the rearrangement rather than being a standard clinical qualifier for the disease itself.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Single-cell analysis of immune and stroma cell remodeling in renal cell carcinoma primary tumors and bone metastatic lesions') was chosen as it contains specific disease terms ('renal cell carcinoma', 'bone metastatic lesions'), which is preferred over the more general session title ('Cancer-associated Inflammation and Microbiome').
2. **Component Identification**: The abstract title explicitly mentions two distinct clinical entities being analyzed: 'renal cell carcinoma primary tumors' and 'bone metastatic lesions'. The conjunction 'and' separates them, indicating they should be treated as separate indications.
3. **Rule Retrieval**: To correctly handle the term 'metastatic', I retrieved rules for the 'Occurrence' category, specifically for 'Metastasis-Related Terms'.
4. **Indication 1 Construction**: For 'renal cell carcinoma primary tumors':
   - The disease is 'renal cell carcinoma'.
   - The qualifier 'primary' is included as it specifies the nature of the tumor, distinguishing it from metastatic sites.
   - The plural 'tumors' was converted to its singular form 'Tumor' as per generic formatting rules.
   - Applying Title Case results in 'Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma'.
5. **Indication 2 Construction**: For 'bone metastatic lesions':
   - This describes a secondary disease site. The term 'metastatic' is a key descriptor.
   - The plural 'lesions' was converted to its singular form 'Lesion'.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title, 'External Validation of a Risk Prediction Tool in Determining Early Death Among Elderly Patients Initiated on Dialysis', lacks a specific disease. 'Early Death' is an outcome, and 'Initiated on Dialysis' is a procedural qualifier, which should be excluded per generic rules. Therefore, I defaulted to the session title.
2.  **Component Identification (Session Title)**: The session title is 'Geriatric Nephrology'. I identified two components: 'Geriatric' (an age group) and 'Nephrology' (a therapeutic area).
3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for the 'Age Group' category, specifically for 'Elderly' and 'Geriatric'. Rule ID 320 and 321 state that 'Geriatric' should be used as a capitalized prefix for the identified disease.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    -   I applied the 'Therapeutic Area Fallback' generic rule to convert the therapeutic area 'Nephrology' into a standard disease term, 'Kidney Disease'.
    -   I applied the retrieved 'Geriatric' age group rule (ID 320/321) to prepend 'Geriatric' to the disease name.

   - Based on the 'Line of treatment' rules (specifically Rule ID 199 and 200), 'First-Line' was retained because it was followed by the generic word 'Treatment' and not a specific drug name. It was normalized to 'First-Line' and placed at the beginning of the indication.
   - 'Advanced Stage' was identified as a clinically significant stage descriptor and was retained and converted to Title Case.
   - 'Folicular Lymphoma' was already in the correct singular and Title Case format.

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('L-Asparaginase Associated Acute Pancreatitis In Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia') was chosen over the session title ('Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Clinical') because it is more specific and contains more detailed information, including multiple conditions and a patient subgroup, adhering to the 'Abstract Title first' principle.

2. **Component Identification**: The abstract title contains two distinct medical conditions: 'Acute Pancreatitis' and 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'. It also identifies a patient subgroup: 'Children'. The phrase 'L-Asparaginase Associated' is identified as a descriptor for Acute Pancreatitis.

3. **Rule Retrieval & Application**:
   - **Age Group**: Rules for 'Childhood' were retrieved using `get_indication_rules(category=""Age Group"", subcategories=[""Childhood""])`. Rule ID 294 directs the replacement of 'Children' with the prefix 'Childhood' before the associated disease name.
   - **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rules for multiple diseases were applied, requiring the extraction of all distinct conditions and separating them with ';;'.
   - **Exclusion Rule**: The descriptor 'L-Asparaginase Associated' indicates that the pancreatitis is a complication or adverse effect of a treatment. According to the generic exclusion rules, 'Complications or adverse effects' should be excluded from the final indication. Therefore, this phrase was removed.

4. **Indication Construction**:
   - The patient subgroup 'Children' is linked to the patients who have Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and the pancreatitis occurs within this group. Therefore, the 'Childhood' qualifier applies to both conditions.
   - 'Acute Pancreatitis' combined with the age qualifier becomes 'Childhood Acute Pancreatitis'.
   - 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia' combined with the age qualifier becomes 'Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'.
   - The two indications are combined using the ';;' separator.

5. **Final Quality Check**: The final output `Childhood Acute Pancreatitis;;Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia` adheres to all formatting rules (Title Case, singular form, no trailing spaces) and accurately reflects the clinically valid indications present in the source title after applying the necessary rules.","[{'category': 'Age Group', 'subcategories': ['Childhood'], 'reason': ""To handle the 'Children' patient subgroup.""}, {'category': 'Patient with two different Disease', 'subcategories': None, 'reason': 'To check for specific rules on handling multiple diseases, though a tool error occurred and generic rules were used instead.'}, {'category': 'Patient Sub-Group', 'subcategories': ['Disease Characterisation'], 'reason': ""To determine if 'L-Asparaginase Associated' is a valid clinical qualifier.""}]","[{'component': 'Acute Pancreatitis', 'type': 'Disease', 'normalized_form': 'Acute Pancreatitis', 'rule_applied': 'Generic disease identification.'}, {'component': 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'type': 'Disease', 'normalized_form': 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'rule_applied': 'Generic disease identification.'}, {'component': 'Children', 'type': 'Age Group', 'normalized_form': 'Childhood', 'rule_applied': ""Age Group Rule ID 294: Replace 'Children' with 'Childhood' and prepend to the disease name.""}, {'component': 'L-Asparaginase Associated', 'type': 'Qualifier', 'normalized_form': '', 'rule_applied': 'Generic Exclusion Rule: Exclude complications or adverse effects.'}]",2

1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title ('Intradialytic Amino Acids Improved Malnutrition Markers in ESRD with Complex Congenital Heart Disease on Peritoneal Dialysis') was chosen over the session title ('Health Maintenance, Nutrition, and Metabolism') because it contains specific disease terms, adhering to the single-source principle.
2. **Component Identification**: Two distinct diseases were identified in the abstract title: 'ESRD' and 'Complex Congenital Heart Disease'. The term 'with' connects them, indicating a patient population with both conditions.
3. **Rule Application (Generic)**:
   - **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring both conditions to be extracted and separated by ';;'.
   - **Standardization**: 'ESRD' was expanded to its full standard name 'End-Stage Renal Disease'.
   - **Exclusion**: The procedural qualifier 'on Peritoneal Dialysis' and the non-diagnostic term 'Malnutrition Markers' were excluded as per generic exclusion rules.
   - **Formatting**: Both indications were converted to Title Case and singular form.
4. **Rule Retrieval (Tool-based)**:
   - A rule check for 'Patient with two different Disease' was performed, but no specific rules were found, defaulting to the generic separator rule.
   - A rule check for 'Disease Characterisation' was done for the term 'Complex'. No specific rule exists, so the clinically significant descriptor 'Complex' was retained.
   - A rule check for 'Genetic Origin' was done for 'Congenital'. No specific rule exists, so this standard medical term, being part of the disease name, was retained.

3. **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Treatment Set-up' (Operative Status), 'Risk' (Risk Types), and 'Patient Sub-Group' (Disease Characterisation) to guide the extraction.

4. **Rule Application and Component Normalization**:
   - **Disease**: 'Renal Cell Cancer' was kept as the core disease, and the abbreviation '(Rcc)' was removed. The term is already in singular form.
   - **Risk Qualifier**: Based on the pattern from retrieved 'Risk Types' rules, 'Very High-Risk' was identified as a critical patient subgroup qualifier and was prepended to the disease name. It was formatted in Title Case.
   - **Histology/Subtype**: 'Clear Cell' is a crucial histological subtype of Renal Cell Cancer. The term 'Histology' was dropped as it is descriptive of the analysis type, not the disease itself. 'Clear Cell' was included in the indication.
   - **Exclusions**: Following generic exclusion rules and the patterns in the retrieved 'Treatment Set-up' rules (e.g., for 'Post Operative'), the terms 'Adjuvant' (treatment timing) and 'Completely Resected' (procedural status) were excluded as they describe the treatment context rather than defining the core indication.

5. **Indication Construction**: The identified and normalized components were assembled in the standard clinical order: [Risk] [Histology/Subtype] [Disease]. This resulted in 'Very High-Risk Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer'.

6. **Final Quality Check**: The final indication was reviewed for compliance with all formatting rules (Title Case, singular form, no extra spaces) and clinical accuracy.

3. **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' with subcategories 'Severity' and 'Disease Characterisation' to guide the handling of 'Mild' and 'Inhibitors'. Although no specific rule for 'Mild' was found, the general principle of prepending severity descriptors to the disease name was applied.
4. **Component Normalization & Application of Rules**:
   - **Disease**: 'Haemophilia A' is a standard medical term and was kept as is, formatted in Title Case.
   - **Severity**: 'Mild' was identified as a direct modifier of the disease and prepended to it, resulting in 'Mild Haemophilia A'.
   - **Patient Subgroup**: 'Inhibitors' in the context of haemophilia is a critical clinical specifier defining a patient subgroup. The phrase 'Inhibitors In' was standardized to the more common clinical phrasing 'With Inhibitors' to create a clear and standard indication.
   - **Exclusions**: The geographic descriptor 'Spanish' and the methodological phrase 'Experience Of A Single Center' were excluded based on generic rules.
5. **Final Construction**: The normalized components were combined in the standard order of [Severity] [Disease] [Subgroup] to form the final indication: 'Mild Haemophilia A With Inhibitors'.

3. **Rule Retrieval**: To ensure correct formatting, rules for 'Diagnosis Status' (for 'Newly Diagnosed') and 'Stage Type' (for 'Advanced-Stage') were retrieved using the `get_indication_rules` tool.
4. **Rule Application**: 
   - The rule for 'Newly Diagnosed' (ID: 193) confirms it should be used as a prefix to the disease name.
   - The general principle for staging terms like 'Advanced-Stage' is to place them before the disease name and normalize formatting. 'Advanced-Stage' was converted to 'Advanced Stage'.
   - The generic exclusion rule was applied to remove the geographic descriptor 'In Taiwan'.
   - The generic singular form and Title Case rules were applied to the entire indication.

1.  **Source Selection**: The abstract title was chosen as it contains specific disease and patient subgroup information ('Anemia Due To Lower-Risk Mds', 'Esa-Naive Patients Requiring Rbc Transfusions'), which is more detailed than the session title ('Myelodysplastic Syndromes - Clinical').

2.  **Component Identification**: I identified the following key components from the abstract title:
    *   Core Condition: 'Anemia'
    *   Underlying Disease: 'Lower-Risk Mds'
    *   Patient Treatment Status: 'Esa-Naive'
    *   Patient Subgroup: 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions'

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I mentally reviewed the rules for handling risk, treatment status, and multiple conditions.
    *   **Risk**: The term 'Lower-Risk' needs to be standardized in Title Case with a hyphen.
    *   **Treatment Status**: 'Esa-Naive' is a critical descriptor of treatment history and should be placed at the beginning of the indication. 'ESA' is an acronym and should be capitalized.
    *   **Disease Normalization**: 'Mds' is a standard abbreviation for Myelodysplastic Syndromes. It should be expanded and converted to singular Title Case: 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome'.
    *   **Patient Subgroup**: 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions' is a key clinical characteristic defining the patient population and must be included.

4.  **Indication Construction**: I assembled the components based on clinical and grammatical conventions:
    *   The primary condition being treated is 'Anemia'. The cause is 'Lower-Risk Mds'. The title explicitly links them with 'Due To'.
    *   The patient population is defined by being 'Esa-Naive' and 'Requiring Rbc Transfusions'.
    *   I started with the treatment status 'ESA-Naive' as it's a primary qualifier.
    *   I then constructed the core indication 'Anemia due to Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome'.
    *   Finally, I appended the patient characteristic 'Requiring RBC Transfusions' to complete the description.

5.  **Final Formatting**: I applied the generic formatting rules:
    *   **Title Case**: Capitalized all significant words (e.g., 'Anemia', 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome'). Short prepositions like 'due to' are in lower case.
    *   **Acronyms**: Kept 'ESA' and 'RBC' in their original all-caps form.
    *   **Singular Form**: Used 'Syndrome' instead of 'Syndromes'.
    *   **Spacing**: Ensured single spaces between all words.

3.  **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient with two different Disease', 'Stage', 'Grade', and 'Treatment Set-up'.
4.  **Rule Application**: 
    *   **Multiple Diseases**: The generic rule for multiple diseases was applied, requiring both conditions to be extracted and separated by ';;'.
    *   **Grade**: The specific rule for 'High Grade' (ID: 115) confirmed it should be normalized to 'High Grade' and placed before the disease name.
    *   **Stage**: 'Advanced' was kept as a standard clinical qualifier for the carcinoma.
    *   **Exclusion**: The phrase 'Receiving Parp Inhibitors' was excluded as it describes a procedural/temporal treatment context, which is a standard exclusion criterion.
    *   **Formatting**: Abbreviations (Vte, Ahgoc) were removed, and the final output was formatted to Title Case and singular form as required.
5.  **Indication Construction**: The first indication was normalized to 'Venous Thromboembolism'. The second indication was constructed by combining the stage ('Advanced'), grade ('High Grade'), and disease ('Ovarian Carcinoma') to form 'Advanced High Grade Ovarian Carcinoma'. The two indications were then combined with the ';;' separator.
6.  **Final Quality Check**: The final output was reviewed for compliance with all formatting, accuracy, and completeness rules.","[{'category': 'Patient with two different Disease', 'subcategories': ['Patient with two different Disease'], 'reason': 'To handle the comorbidity context of VTE in patients with ovarian cancer.'}, {'category': 'Stage', 'subcategories': ['Stage Type'], 'reason': ""To check for rules regarding the term 'Advanced'.""}, {'category': 'Grade', 'subcategories': ['Grade'], 'reason': ""To apply the correct formatting for 'High Grade'.""}, {'category': 'Treatment Set-up', 'subcategories': ['Treatment Status'], 'reason': ""To confirm the exclusion of 'Receiving Parp Inhibitors'.""}]","[{'component': 'Venous Thromboembolism (Vte)', 'type': 'Disease', 'normalized_form': 'Venous Thromboembolism', 'rule_applied': 'Generic rule: Remove abbreviations and apply Title Case.'}, {'component': 'Advanced High Grade Ovarian Carcinoma (Ahgoc)', 'type': 'Disease', 'normalized_form': 'Advanced High Grade Ovarian Carcinoma', 'rule_applied': ""Combination of generic rules (Title Case, remove abbreviation) and specific rule for 'High Grade' (ID: 115).""}, {'component': 'Receiving Parp Inhibitors', 'type': 'Treatment Context', 'normalized_form': '', 'rule_applied': 'Generic exclusion rule for procedural/temporal qualifiers.'}]",2

1. **Source Selection**: The 'abstract_title' was chosen over the 'session_title' as it provides a more detailed and specific description of the medical indication.
2. **Component Identification**: The key clinical components identified in the abstract title were 'Her2-Positive', 'Breast Cancer', and 'Brain Metastases'.
3. **Rule Application and Normalization**:
   - **Biomarker**: 'Her2-Positive' was identified as a biomarker. The standard format for gene symbols/biomarkers is all-caps, so it was normalized to 'HER2-Positive'.
   - **Disease**: 'Breast Cancer' is the core disease and is already in the correct singular, Title Case format.
   - **Metastasis**: 'Brain Metastases' describes a specific patient subgroup. The generic rule for singularization was applied, converting 'Metastases' to 'Metastasis'.
4. **Indication Construction**: The components were combined to form a single, clinically precise indication. The phrase 'Patients With' explicitly links the brain metastasis to the primary breast cancer, defining a specific patient population rather than two separate diseases. The final indication is structured as '[Biomarker] [Disease] with [Metastatic Site]'.

1.  **Analyze Input Titles**: The abstract title is 'Free from Maintenance Drug Therapy in Multiple Myeloma (The FREEDMM Trial): A Pilot Study of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Driven Discontinuation of Maintenance'. The session title is 'Myeloma and Plasma Cell Dyscrasias: Prospective Therapeutic Trials: Poster II'.
2.  **Select Source**: The abstract title contains the specific disease 'Multiple Myeloma'. According to the single-source principle, the abstract title is preferred and will be used exclusively.
3.  **Identify Components**: The core disease identified is 'Multiple Myeloma'. Other phrases include 'Free from Maintenance Drug Therapy', 'Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Driven', and 'Discontinuation of Maintenance'.
4.  **Retrieve Rules**: I retrieved rules for 'Patient Sub-Group' and 'Treatment Set-up' to determine how to handle the identified components.
5.  **Apply Rules**: 
    *   The core disease 'Multiple Myeloma' is kept. It is already in singular form and Title Case.
    *   'Free from Maintenance Drug Therapy' and 'Discontinuation of Maintenance' are procedural/temporal qualifiers describing the study's intervention, not the patient's baseline indication. Based on the generic exclusion rules, these are removed.
    *   'Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Driven' describes the methodology used to guide treatment decisions within the trial. It is not a standard patient subgroup that defines the indication itself. No specific rule mandates its inclusion, so it is excluded under the generic rule for non-diagnostic/methodological items.
6.  **Construct Indication**: After excluding the non-indication components, the only remaining element is the core disease.
