  "validation_reasoning": "Systematic validation completed across all 6 checks. Source selection is correct as abstract title contains the disease term 'burkitt lymphoma', triggering the Single-Source Extraction Principle to use only the abstract title. All components in the generated indication are grounded in the source title with appropriate rule-based transformations. The critical decision to exclude CD19/CD22 was verified against Biomarker rules and the Association Integrity Rule—the title describes therapy targets, not patient biomarker status, making exclusion correct. The 'Relapsed/Refractory' format was verified against Occurrence Rule 11 (First-Relapse), which explicitly specifies this exact format with forward slash and no spaces when both terms appear together. Transplantation exclusion aligns with Treatment Set-up rules and generic procedural exclusions. All formatting rules (Title Case, singular form, spacing) correctly applied. No errors, omissions, or rule violations detected. The extraction demonstrates proper agentic workflow with correct rule retrieval and application."
