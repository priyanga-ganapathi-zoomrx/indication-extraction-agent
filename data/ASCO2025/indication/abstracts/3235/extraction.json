  "reasoning": "Step-by-step extraction process:\n1. **Source Selection**: The abstract title contains the disease 'burkitt lymphoma', so it is selected as the primary source, and the session title is ignored, following the Single-Source Extraction Principle.\n2. **Component Identification**: I identified the following components in the abstract title: 'Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation' (procedure), 'CD19/CD22 dual-target CAR-T therapy' (treatment description), 'refractory or relapsed' (occurrence/disease state), and 'burkitt lymphoma' (disease).\n3. **Rule Retrieval**: I retrieved rules for 'Occurrence' to handle 'refractory or relapsed' and for 'Treatment Set-up' to handle 'transplantation'. I also considered 'Biomarker' rules for CD19/CD22.\n4. **Rule Application & Component Refinement**:\n   - **Procedure Exclusion**: The generic exclusion rules and the retrieved 'Treatment Set-up' rules (e.g., for 'Post-Transplant') mandate the exclusion of procedural terms. Therefore, 'Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation followed by...' is removed.\n   - **Treatment Description Exclusion**: The phrase 'CD19/CD22 dual-target CAR-T therapy' describes the treatment, not the disease itself. The Association Integrity Rule requires excluding components not directly modifying the disease. The title does not state the lymphoma is CD19/CD22 positive, only that the therapy targets them. Thus, this component is excluded.\n   - **Occurrence Standardization**: The retrieved 'Occurrence' rules for 'Refractory' and 'Relapsed' guide the standardization of 'refractory or relapsed'. This is combined and normalized to the standard clinical format 'Relapsed/Refractory'.\n   - **Disease Formatting**: The disease 'burkitt lymphoma' is converted to Title Case and singular form, resulting in 'Burkitt Lymphoma'.\n5. **Final Indication Construction**: The standardized components are assembled in the correct order: [Occurrence] [Disease]. This results in 'Relapsed/Refractory Burkitt Lymphoma'.",
