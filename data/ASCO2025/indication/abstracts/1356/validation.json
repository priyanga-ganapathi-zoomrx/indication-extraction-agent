  "validation_reasoning": "All 6 validation checks passed successfully. The extractor correctly identified the abstract title as the source (contains disease term 'glioblastoma'). The single disease component 'glioblastoma' was properly extracted and normalized to 'Glioblastoma' following Title Case formatting. The extractor appropriately excluded biological processes ('mesenchymal cell transition' and 'immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization') per the Non-Diagnostic Items exclusion rule. Critically, C/EBP? was correctly omitted because it appears in a mechanism-of-action context ('C/EBP?-dependent mesenchymal cell transition') rather than as a disease qualifier or patient selection criterion, consistent with the Association Integrity Rule. No components were hallucinated, no relevant terms were omitted, and all formatting rules were properly applied. The extraction is clinically accurate and compliant with all reference rules."
