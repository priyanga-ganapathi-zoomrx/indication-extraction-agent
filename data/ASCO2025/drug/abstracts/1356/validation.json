The extractor correctly followed Rule 9 by capturing only the generic name 'Lucicebtide' and omitting the code name 'ST101' provided in parentheses.\n3. Mechanism of action terms ('antagonism') and biological processes ('mesenchymal cell transition') were correctly excluded per Rule 23.\n4. No other drugs or comparators are present in the title.\n5. The extraction is accurate and compliant with all provided rules."
