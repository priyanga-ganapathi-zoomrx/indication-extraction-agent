Verified 'CD19/CD22 Dual-Target CAR-T' is a valid therapeutic agent via grounded search.\n3. Identified a violation of Rule 14: CAR-T must be captured as 'CAR-T Cell'. The extraction omitted the word 'Cell'.\n4. Identified that while Rule 16 allows for directed/targeted prefixes, the formatting must still adhere to the 'Cell' suffix requirement.\n5. Conclusion: FAIL due to high-severity formatting violation of specific cell therapy rules."
