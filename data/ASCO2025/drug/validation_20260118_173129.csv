1356,Use of lucicebtide (ST101) in glioblastoma patients by antagonism of C/EBP?-dependent mesenchymal cell transition and immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization.,Sapience Therapeutics,"Background: C/EBP? is a master regulator of the mesenchymal phenotype in GBM and has an essential role in the maintenance of immunosuppressive M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Lucicebtide is a first-in-class antagonist of C/EBP? that has shown direct anti-tumor activity in GBM as well as the ability to reprogram TAMs in the TME toward immunostimulatory M1 macrophages. In a recent recurrent GBM (rGBM) P2 study, lucicebtide was well-tolerated and resulted in disease control in 9/30 patients, including two PRs lasting > 1 year. With strong rationale for targeting C/EBP? in GBM, additional cohorts we explored in a window-of-opportunity (WoO) study (NCT04478279). Methods: The WoO study enrolled 2 cohorts; 9 pts with rGBM that received 2-4 doses of lucicebtide 500mg QW prior to surgery and resumed lucicebtide after surgery to progression and 9 ndGBM pts that received 2-3 doses of lucicebtide 500mg QW prior to surgery and resumed lucicebtide + chemoradiation after surgery until progression. Endpoints include efficacy parameters of PFS and OS, safety as a single agent and in combination with chemoradiation, and pharmacodynamic analyses including spatial transcriptomics and TME characterization. Results: Lucicebtide was well-tolerated as a single agent and in combination with chemoradiation. Tissue analysis indicates penetration past the BBB and tumor uptake, as well as C/EBP? target engagement. Lucicebtide + chemoradiation in ndGBM extended PFS beyond historic benchmarks, with the majority of patients remaining on study without progression (7-22+ months). As of January 25, 2025, mOS could not be evaluated, with 8/9 patients alive. In rGBM, lucicebtide improved mPFS to 3.4 months and mOS to at least 11.8 months, exceeding historical data with chemotherapy (historic mPFS ~ 2 months and mOS 5.6-9.8 months). Pathologic evidence of treatment effect, i.e. geographic necrosis, was observed in 5/6 pts including otherwise treatment naïve ndGBM patients. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed a significant reduction in the mesenchymal gene signature following lucicebtide, consistent with on-target antagonism of C/EBP?. Further, immune activation in the TME, as indicated by increased M1/M2 ratio and CD8+ T cell infiltration, was associated with disease control. Conclusions: Lucicebtide is well-tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with SoC. Improvements in PFS and OS in GBM patients following lucicebtide exposure demonstrated penetration across the BBB and target engagement, resulting in on-target pharmacodynamic activity including a dramatic reduction in mesenchymal gene signature in tumor cells and a remodeling towards a more permissive immune TME. These data provide the mechanistic rationale for continued clinical evaluation of lucicebtide as a novel approach for patients with GBM.","{

3235,Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation followed by CD19/CD22 dual-target CAR-T therapy for refractory or relapsed burkitt lymphoma,"Hebei Senlang Biotechnology, Kecellitics Biotech Company","Background Relapsed and refractory (R/R) Burkitt's lymphoma is characterized by its aggressive nature and poor
prognosis. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has demonstrated limited efficacy
in treating R/R Burkitt lymphoma. Similarly, CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has
shown ineffectiveness for these patients. Emerging evidence suggests that the combination of ASCT with
dual-target CAR-T therapy (CD19/CD22) may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Methods This study analyzed 13 patients with R/R Burkitt lymphoma from July 2020 to May 2025, all enrolled in a
single-center clinical trial investigating sequential ASCT followed by CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy for R/R B-
cell lymphoma (NCT05206071). Comprehensive assessments, including MYC FISH, TP53 FISH, and gene
mutation detection, were performed on all participants.  After enrollment, bridging therapies included local radiotherapy targeting large masses. The initial ASCT
regimen was BEAM until 2022; it was then modified to Be+IDA+FLU+Ara-C+melphalan (BIFAM). CD19 and
CD22 CAR-T cells were infused simultaneously at a median interval of 5 days post-ASCT (range: 2-11 days),
with dosages of 2*10^6/kg for CD19 and 1*10^6/kg for CD22. Therapeutic effects were evaluated through bone marrow examinations and imaging studies (CT, MRI,
PET-CT) conducted one month, two months, and three months after CAR-T cell infusion; subsequent
evaluations occurred every three months thereafter. One month post-infusion of CAR-T cells,
maintenance therapy with a CD20 monoclonal antibody and chidamide (an histone deacetylase
inhibitors, HDACi) was initiated. Results: There were 9 males and 4 females, with a median age of 29 years (range: 4 to 44). FISH analysis revealed
TP53 deletion or mutation in 8 out of the 10 cases (80%). Among the patients, there were 3 in Clinical
Stage II and 10 in Stage IV. Large masses were present in 8 patients (61.5%), while bone marrow or
central nervous system (CNS) invasion occurred in 5 patients (38.5%). Radiotherapy was administered to
7 patients (53.8%). Three patients received BEAM therapy, and ten cases underwent BIFAM for ASCT
regimen. The median stem cell infusion dose was calculated at 5.7×10^6/kg(range:2.5-17.4×10^6/kg). All patients completed treatment safely. CD19 CAR-T and CD22 CART cell amplification peaks occurred on
days 10 (8.9%) and day 15 (16.3%), respectively. Adverse events included grade I/II cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) observed in twelve cases (92.3%); no instances of grade III CRS or immune effector cell-
related neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were reported. The overall response rate (ORR)within three months was76.9% (10/13), with CR of 61.5% (8/13). One and
two-year OS rates were both 65.6% (95%CI 38.2-93.1), while one and two-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 56.3% (95%CI 27.2-85.3). Subgroup analyses indicated that there were no significant
differences in 2-year OS and PFS based on the presence of large masses versus their absence (57.1% vs.
80%), bone marrow ±CNS involvement (53.3% vs. 71.4%), TP53 abnormalities (71.4% vs. 50%), bridging
therapy with radiotherapy versus without it (71.4% vs. 53.3%), BEAM versus BIFAM regimens (66.7% vs.
66.7%) (all p>0.05). Conclusion This clinical trial confirmed the efficacy and safety of ASCT followed by CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy for R/R
Burkitt lymphoma, demonstrating a 2-year OS rate of 65.6% and a 2-year PFS rate of 56.3%. This
treatment protocol effectively addresses high-risk factors such as TP53 abnormalities, large tumor
masses, and involvement of bone marrow or CNS. It is suggested that incorporating radiotherapy for
large masses, optimizing the ASCT regimen with idarubicin and fludarabine, as well as implementing
maintenance therapy with CD20 antibodies and HDACi following CAR-T treatment may enhance
therapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, there remains a need to further optimize the treatment strategy.
Additionally, the small sample size in this study necessitates validation in larger cohorts to confirm these
findings.","{

3291,"Phase 2 trial of zilovertamab vedotin in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone plus rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Updated analysis of waveline-007",Merck,"Background: Despite progress made with combination therapies that include cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin and prednisone plus rituximab (R-CHP) and polatuzomab vedotin, outcomes for patients
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) leave room for improvement. The receptor tyrosine kinase-
like orphan receptor 1 (ROR-1) is a cell-surface protein overexpressed in most lymphoid cancers including
DLBCL (Daneshmanesh et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2022). Zilovertamab vedotin (ZV) is a novel ROR1-targeting
antibody-drug conjugate that has shown promising efficacy in patients with DLBCL (Norasetthada et al.
2024). The phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial (NCT05406401) evaluated the safety and efficacy of ZV plus R-CHP
in participants with untreated DLBCL. We previously reported results of waveLINE-007 with 36
participants and 10 months of follow up where the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined
to be ZV 1.75 mg/kg. All 15 (100%) participants receiving ZV 1.75 mg/kg plus R-CHP achieved complete
response (CR) at end-of-treatment with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% and median duration of
response (DOR) not reached. We present an updated analysis of the waveLINE-007 trial with an
additional 16 months of follow-up. Methods: Eligible participants were aged ?18 years with DLBCL confirmed by positron emission
tomography by BICR per Lugano criteria, no prior treatment for DLBCL, and ECOG performance score 0-1
to receive ZV (1.75, 2.0, 2.25 mg/kg) plus R-CHP Q3W for 6 or 8 cycles. Primary endpoints were safety,
RP2D, and CR per Lugano 2014 response criteria by investigator. Secondary endpoints were ORR and
DOR per Lugano criteria by investigator. Tertiary/Exploratory endpoints included overall survival (OS). Results: At data cut-off (May 6, 2025), the median follow-up was 26.6 months with 36 participants
enrolled to receive ZV 1.75 mg/kg (n=15), 2.0 mg/kg (n=15), or 2.25 mg/kg (n=6) plus R-CHP. Overall, 34
(94%) participants completed the trial, and 2 (6%) discontinued treatment due to physician decision (ZV
2.0 mg/kg, n=1; ZV 2.25 mg/kg, n=1). Overall, 21 (58%) participants were female, 17 (47%) were ?65 years
old, 21 (58%) had ECOG performance score of 1, 18 (50%) had Ann Arbor stage IV disease, and 3 (8%) had a NCCN International Prognostic Index of high risk. Participants with germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL
were 15 (42%), with non-GCB were 16 (44%), and unknown 5 (14%). Treatment-related adverse events (AE) were reported in all 36 (100%) participants, the most common
being neutropenia (n=15 [42%]), nausea (n=10 [28%]), anemia (n=9 [25%]), diarrhea (n=7 [19%]),
peripheral sensory neuropathy (n=7 [19%]), and neutrophil count decreased (n=6 [17%]). Grade ?3
treatment-related AEs were reported in 21 (58%) participants, the most common being neutropenia
(n=13 [36%]), neutrophil count decreased (n=6 [17%]), and febrile neutropenia (n=5 [14%]). No treatment-
related deaths were reported. Complete response was achieved in all 15 (100%) participants receiving ZV 1.75 mg/kg, 14 (93%)
participants receiving ZV 2.0 mg/kg, and all 6 (100%) participants receiving ZV 2.25 mg/kg, for an overall
CR rate of 97.2% (95% CI, 86-100). The ORR was 100%, 93%, and 100% for participants receiving ZV 1.75
mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and 2.25 mg/kg, respectively. The median duration of CR was not reached (NR) for all
participants, with 24-month CR rate of 84%. All participants with GCB (n=5) and non-GCB (n=7) DLBCL
receiving ZV 1.75 mg/kg achieved complete response. An estimated 84% of participants overall had
response duration ?24 months. The 24-month PFS and OS rates were 84% and 94%, respectively, for all
participants. For participants receiving ZV 1.75 mg/kg, the 24-month PFS and OS rates were 100% and
100%, respectively, for those with GCB DLBCL, and 83.3% and 100%, for those with non-GCB DLBCL. Conclusions:  After approximately 27 months of follow-up, ZV plus R-CHP continues to demonstrate
robust efficacy and acceptable safety as front-line treatment for participants with DLBCL regardless of
cell of origin. No new safety concerns were reported.","{
