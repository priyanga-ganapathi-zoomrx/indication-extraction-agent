"""Temporal configuration for abstract extraction workflows.

This module defines:
- Task queue names for routing work to appropriate workers
- Timeout configurations for different activity types
- Retry policies following Temporal best practices
- Worker settings for concurrency control

Task Queue Design:
- WORKFLOWS: Lightweight orchestration only
- CHECKPOINT: Cross-cutting storage operations (load/save status, step outputs)
- DRUG: Drug extraction LLM activities
- DRUG_CLASS: Drug class classification pipeline
- INDICATION_EXTRACTION: Fast indication extraction (GPT-4)
- INDICATION_VALIDATION: Slow validation (Sonnet 4.5)

Best Practices Applied:
- Separate queues by workload characteristics (latency, resource needs)
- Checkpoint queue shared across all pipelines for storage ops
- LLM queues separated by latency profile
- Non-retryable errors for validation/parsing failures

# TASK QUEUES

# Design principles:
# - Workflows on dedicated queue (lightweight orchestration)
# - Checkpoint activities on shared queue (fast storage, cross-cutting)
# - LLM activities grouped by latency profile and entity type
# - Slow activities isolated to prevent blocking fast ones
